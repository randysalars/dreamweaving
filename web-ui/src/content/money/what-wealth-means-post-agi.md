# What Wealth Means Post-AGI

**Direct answer:** Post-AGI, wealth means durable optionality: control over time, access to resources, trusted networks, and systems that survive regime changes.
**Mechanism:** When output is cheap, the scarce factors become governance, trust, and constraints on access, not raw production.
**Implication:** Build resilient assets: trust, distribution, ownership, and skills that improve judgment.

## Definitions

- **Optionality:** the menu of survivable moves.
- **Access:** ability to use resources when needed.
- **Governance:** rules and control structures that determine outcomes.
- **Regime change:** a shift in underlying assumptions (policy, technology, incentives).

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Abundant intelligence and execution reduce the price of routine labor.
2. Scarcity shifts to access, trust, and control of systems.
3. Therefore, durable wealth becomes governance, resilience, and optionality rather than just income.

## Where this breaks down

- Transitional periods can be chaotic; old rules can persist longer than expected.
- Some physical constraints remain scarce and expensive.
- Concentrated power can create new risks that must be managed.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **identity as a job title**
- Start measuring: **assets that increase options (ownership, trust, distribution, runway)**
- Redesign: **work and life around resilience to regime changes**

## Summary

Post-AGI wealth is not just money. It is durable optionality: access, control, trust, and resilience. In the Money Flow Model, these are already the fundamentals, which is why the same core drivers remain relevant even as tools change.
