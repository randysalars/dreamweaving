# What Is Capital?

**Direct answer:** Capital is stored capacity to produce outcomes. It includes money, tools, systems, code, distribution, and reputation.
**Mechanism:** Capital matters because it lets you solve problems with fewer new inputs. It converts effort into leverage.
**Implication:** If you only have labor, you are forced to re-solve the same problems repeatedly.

## Definitions

- **Capital:** stored capability that can generate future value.
- **Physical capital:** equipment, infrastructure, inventory.
- **Financial capital:** cash and claims (stocks, bonds).
- **Social capital:** trust, reputation, relationships, access.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Solving a problem once can be converted into a reusable asset.
2. Reusable assets reduce marginal cost and increase reach.
3. Therefore, capital is what enables compounding instead of constant restarting.

## Where this breaks down

- Capital can decay (obsolete tools, damaged reputation, outdated systems).
- Some capital is illiquid or fragile in a regime change.
- Capital can create complacency if it is treated as permanent.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **short-term cash extraction**
- Start measuring: **assets that reduce future effort (systems, templates, distribution, trust)**
- Redesign: **work so every project leaves behind reusable capital**

## Summary

Capital is stored problem-solving capacity. It turns work into compounding by lowering marginal cost and expanding reach. In the Money Flow Model, capital becomes durable when it is aligned with value creation, trust, and risk control.
