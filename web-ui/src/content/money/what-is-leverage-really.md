# What Is Leverage (Really)?

**Direct answer:** Leverage is any multiplier that makes one unit of input produce more than one unit of output. It is not hustle. It is structure.
**Mechanism:** Leverage works because it separates creation from repetition, reducing marginal cost and increasing reach.
**Implication:** The practical goal is not to work less. The goal is to stop selling hours as your only product.

## Definitions

- **Leverage:** non-linear amplification of an input.
- **Marginal cost:** cost of producing one additional unit of output.
- **Distribution:** the ability to reach buyers efficiently.
- **Ownership:** the ability to capture upside from leverage.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Linear work is capped by time and attention.
2. Leverage turns work into assets that can be reused and distributed.
3. Therefore, leverage creates compounding where effort alone cannot.

## Where this breaks down

- Leverage amplifies mistakes and bad incentives.
- Leverage requires trust to scale without backlash.
- Leverage can create fragility if you automate without understanding.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **being busy**
- Start measuring: **assets built per week (systems, code, media, proof)**
- Redesign: **work so it can be delivered repeatedly without your presence**

## Summary

Leverage is delayed amplification. It turns inputs into reusable outputs and increases reach. In the Money Flow Model, leverage accelerates money flow when paired with trust and value, and it becomes dangerous when paired with unmanaged downside.
