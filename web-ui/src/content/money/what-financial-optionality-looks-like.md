# What Financial Optionality Looks Like

**Direct answer:** Financial optionality looks like time, flexibility, and access: runway, low fixed obligations, transferable skills, and trusted relationships.
**Mechanism:** Optionality exists when you can respond to shocks without selling under pressure or accepting bad terms.
**Implication:** The best wealth plan increases your good moves and reduces your forced moves.

## Definitions

- **Runway:** months you can operate without new income.
- **Fixed obligations:** payments and commitments that do not flex down easily.
- **Transferable skills:** skills that convert across industries and markets.
- **Access:** ability to reach opportunities through trust and networks.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Shocks create forced decisions for people with low runway and high obligations.
2. Optionality provides time and alternatives.
3. Therefore, optionality is how you avoid desperation and compound better decisions.

## Where this breaks down

- Optionality is not just money. It is also health, skills, and relationships.
- Too much optionality without direction can create drift.
- Some obligations are strategic; the goal is not zero commitment, but sustainable commitment.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **status spending that increases fixed obligations**
- Start measuring: **runway, obligations, and dependency count**
- Redesign: **your life so you can walk away from bad deals and wait for good ones**

## Summary

Optionality is the ability to choose under uncertainty. It looks like runway, low obligations, transferable skills, and trusted access. In the Money Flow Model, optionality is the asset money is often trying to buy, and risk control is how you keep it.
