# Why Speed Is Often More Valuable Than Quality

**Direct answer:** Speed is often more valuable because it changes the game: it captures timing, reduces uncertainty sooner, and compounds learning faster.
**Mechanism:** Speed creates advantage because information and opportunities decay. A good answer now can beat a perfect answer too late.
**Implication:** Optimize for reliable delivery and fast feedback, then improve quality through iteration.

## Definitions

- **Speed:** time-to-decision or time-to-delivery.
- **Quality:** fitness for purpose, not perfection.
- **Timing:** alignment with a window of demand or opportunity.
- **Feedback loop:** the cycle time from action to learning.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Markets and environments change; windows open and close.
2. Speed reduces the time you spend being wrong and increases learning rate.
3. Therefore, speed functions as leverage by compounding iteration.

## Where this breaks down

- In high-stakes domains, errors are expensive and speed must be bounded.
- Some buyers pay for craftsmanship and durability over timing.
- Speed without clarity creates rework, which destroys real speed.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **perfection before proof**
- Start measuring: **cycle time and rework rate**
- Redesign: **delivery into small, testable units with clear standards**

## Summary

Speed is valuable because timing and learning are leverage. In the Money Flow Model, money moves toward reduced uncertainty and faster resolution of outcomes, as long as speed does not create unacceptable risk.
