# What Is Money?

**Direct answer:** Money is a transferable ledger of claims on goods, services, and future labor. It is a coordination tool that makes exchange possible at scale.
**Mechanism:** Money works because it compresses trust and information into a medium that lets strangers trade without negotiating a custom barter each time.
**Implication:** If you treat money as morality, you will misunderstand how it moves. Treat it as coordination, and its behavior becomes predictable.

## Definitions

- **Money:** a ledger of transferable claims; a unit for pricing and settling exchange.
- **Currency:** the specific tokens used in a money system (cash, bank deposits).
- **Credit:** a claim on future repayment; an extension of trust.
- **Inflation:** a decline in purchasing power of the money unit over time.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. In barter, trade requires a double coincidence of wants and a negotiated exchange rate.
2. Money standardizes pricing and settlement so trade becomes modular.
3. Therefore, money expands the size of cooperation and the complexity of the economy.

## Where this breaks down

- Money does not guarantee value. You can be paid for things that are not socially useful.
- Money can be distorted by policy, leverage, fraud, and incentives.
- Money measures claims, not meaning. A high price is not proof of importance.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **moral narratives about who "deserves" money**
- Start measuring: **how trust, risk, and incentives affect price and flow**
- Redesign: **your strategy around creating measurable value and reducing friction for a specific buyer**

## Summary

Money is a coordination technology. It is a portable record of claims that lets trust and exchange scale beyond small groups. In the Money Flow Model, money moves toward clarity, trust, reduced friction, leverage, and optionality, and it moves away from unmanaged downside.
