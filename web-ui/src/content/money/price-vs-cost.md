# Price vs Cost

**Direct answer:** Price is the sticker number. Cost is the full sacrifice: time, risk, maintenance, attention, and the consequences of failure.
**Mechanism:** People overpay by buying low price with high hidden cost, because hidden costs are delayed and hard to feel in the moment.
**Implication:** When evaluating anything financial, ask what you are paying with besides money.

## Definitions

- **Price:** the money amount exchanged.
- **Cost:** the total resources sacrificed over time.
- **Total cost of ownership:** maintenance, downtime, coordination, and replacement.
- **Opportunity cost:** what you cannot do because you chose this.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Low prices can hide high maintenance, poor reliability, or bad incentives.
2. Hidden costs accumulate through friction and risk.
3. Therefore, the cheapest option often becomes the most expensive over time.

## Where this breaks down

- Some premium pricing is pure signal without real cost reduction.
- Some hidden costs are hard to predict without experience.
- Some contexts require lowest price because capital is constrained.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **sticker price**
- Start measuring: **time cost, failure cost, and maintenance burden**
- Redesign: **purchases and systems to reduce friction and prevent catastrophic failure**

## Summary

Price is a number. Cost is the total sacrifice over time. In the Money Flow Model, money moves toward certainty and reduced friction, which is why reliable options often win even when they cost more upfront.
