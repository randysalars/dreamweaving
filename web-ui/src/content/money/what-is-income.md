# What Is Income?

**Direct answer:** Income is a recurring inflow of money over time. It is a stream, not a store.
**Mechanism:** Income matters because it funds your operating costs, but it does not create wealth unless it produces durable surplus.
**Implication:** A high income can still be fragile if it is volatile, conditional, or paired with high fixed obligations.

## Definitions

- **Income:** money received over time.
- **Revenue:** money received by a business; not the same as profit.
- **Profit:** revenue minus costs; the part that can become wealth.
- **Volatility:** how much income varies over time.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Income pays for ongoing life expenses and business operating costs.
2. Wealth forms when a portion of income becomes surplus that survives shocks.
3. Therefore, income quality (stability and durability) often matters more than income size.

## Where this breaks down

- Windfalls create false confidence if treated as permanent.
- Variable income can be high but unpredictable, which increases stress and bad decisions.
- Income dependent on one counterparty is a single point of failure.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **headline income without assessing stability**
- Start measuring: **income volatility and dependency count**
- Redesign: **toward multiple streams or a stream with strong contracts, trust, and pricing power**

## Summary

Income is a stream. Wealth is stored optionality. In the Money Flow Model, income becomes wealth when it produces surplus that survives shocks, compounds through leverage, and is protected from irreversible downside.
