# What AI Changes About Wealth

**Direct answer:** AI changes the price of execution. It makes routine output cheaper and faster, and it increases the returns to judgment, trust, ownership, and distribution.
**Mechanism:** When execution becomes abundant, differentiation shifts to deciding what to do, proving it works, and distributing it reliably.
**Implication:** Build assets and proof. Do not anchor your income on tasks that AI can replicate cheaply.

## Definitions

- **Execution:** producing output (writing, coding, analysis, operations).
- **Judgment:** selecting the right problems, constraints, and tradeoffs.
- **Leverage:** non-linear amplification of inputs.
- **Distribution:** reliable access to buyers and attention.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. AI reduces marginal cost of many forms of execution.
2. Lower marginal cost shifts pricing power away from routine labor.
3. Therefore, wealth concentrates around ownership, judgment, trust, and distribution.

## Where this breaks down

- Some domains remain scarce due to regulation, liability, or physical constraints.
- Trust becomes even more valuable; low-quality output increases noise.
- Over-reliance on AI can reduce understanding and increase fragility.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **routine output as your moat**
- Start measuring: **proof, distribution reach, and asset ownership**
- Redesign: **work so AI amplifies you while you retain judgment and accountability**

## Summary

AI makes execution cheap. Durable wealth shifts toward judgment, trust, leverage, and distribution. In the Money Flow Model, these are already the primary drivers of flow, which is why AI accelerates the advantage of good models and durable systems.
