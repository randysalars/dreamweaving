# Money vs Value

**Direct answer:** Money is a coordination ledger. Value is cost removed for a specific person in a specific context. Markets attempt to price value, but they often misprice it.
**Mechanism:** Money and value diverge because prices are set by incentives, constraints, and information, not by moral truth.
**Implication:** If you want to be paid, you must make value legible and tradable, not just real.

## Definitions

- **Money:** transferable claims used to settle exchange.
- **Value:** time saved, risk reduced, or outcomes stabilized.
- **Price:** the current exchange rate for a claim.
- **Incentives:** what people are rewarded for doing within a system.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Value can be real but invisible (no distribution, no proof, unclear buyer).
2. Money flows to what is legible, trusted, and accessible.
3. Therefore, the highest-value work is not always the highest-paid work.

## Where this breaks down

- Some markets are captured or distorted by policy, monopoly, or fraud.
- Some value is delayed. It is hard to price before it is proven.
- Some pricing reflects scarcity rather than utility.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **being right without being legible**
- Start measuring: **buyer clarity, proof artifacts, and distribution reach**
- Redesign: **your work into a clear offer with measurable outcomes and low buyer risk**

## Summary

Money is not value. Money measures claims. Value is cost removed for an outcome. In the Money Flow Model, money moves toward value when value is legible, trusted, and distributed, and it moves away when incentives and information distort pricing.
