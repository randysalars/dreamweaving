# What Is Value?

**Direct answer:** Value is the reduction of cost on the path to a desired outcome. The cost can be time, uncertainty, coordination, or risk.
**Mechanism:** Markets pay for value because value increases predictability, and predictability reduces the buyer's downside.
**Implication:** If you want to be paid more, stop describing effort and start describing cost removed for the buyer.

## Definitions

- **Value:** cost removed from the path to an outcome.
- **Outcome:** the state the buyer wants to reach.
- **Friction:** anything that makes the outcome harder to reach.
- **Certainty:** the probability of the outcome being achieved.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Buyers care about outcomes, not your internal process.
2. Value appears when an outcome becomes easier, faster, safer, or more likely.
3. Therefore, money tends to reward what stabilizes outcomes and reduces uncertainty.

## Where this breaks down

- Value is not universal. It depends on context and constraints.
- Some outcomes are priced poorly because incentives are misaligned.
- Value can be invisible if you cannot communicate it and distribute it.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **busywork that does not change an outcome**
- Start measuring: **before/after time, risk, and certainty for one buyer type**
- Redesign: **your offer into a small promise that can be proven**

## Summary

Value is cost removed on the path to an outcome. Markets pay for predictability, not exertion. In the Money Flow Model, value is what attracts money when paired with trust, reduced friction, and distribution that makes the value visible.
