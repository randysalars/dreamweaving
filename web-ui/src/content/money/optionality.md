# Optionality: The Real Definition of Wealth

**Direct answer:** Optionality is the number of good moves you can make without breaking. Wealth is stored optionality across time, relationships, skills, and capital.
**Mechanism:** Optionality matters because it prevents forced choices. Forced choices usually happen at the worst time, with the worst terms.
**Implication:** If your life requires one fragile income stream to keep working, you are not wealthy, even if your income is high.

## Definitions

- **Optionality:** the ability to choose among survivable moves.
- **Fragility:** a small shock causes a large, irreversible setback.
- **Resilience:** a shock is absorbed without losing core function.
- **Runway:** how long you can operate without new income.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. The world changes faster than plans do.
2. Optionality gives you time and flexibility to respond.
3. Therefore, optionality converts uncertainty into opportunity instead of disaster.

## Where this breaks down

- Optionality is not infinite. It can decay if you stop maintaining skills and relationships.
- Optionality can be confused with hoarding. Cash is one option, not all options.
- Optionality can be reduced by lifestyle lock-in. Fixed obligations shrink the menu of moves.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **status spending**
- Start measuring: **runway and dependency count (how many things must go right)**
- Redesign: **your life around fewer single points of failure and more transferable skills**

## Summary

Wealth is stored optionality. Optionality is the ability to move without coercion. In the Money Flow Model, optionality is what money is often used to buy: time, flexibility, and protection from forced trades under stress.
