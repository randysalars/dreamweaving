# Why Over-Automation Creates Fragility

**Direct answer:** Over-automation creates fragility when it removes understanding. The system works until it does not, and then nobody can intervene effectively.
**Mechanism:** Fragility rises because automation hides complexity and shifts skill from doing to supervising, which degrades intuition about failure modes.
**Implication:** Automate routine work, but keep the ability to reason about the system and handle exceptions.

## Definitions

- **Automation:** delegating execution to a system.
- **Fragility:** sensitivity to shocks that cause large failures.
- **Failure mode:** how a system breaks under stress.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** a human reviews or intervenes when needed.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Automation removes repetition, which also removes practice and understanding.
2. Edge cases and regime changes are inevitable.
3. Therefore, over-automation increases the cost of rare failures, because recovery skill atrophies.

## Where this breaks down

- Some automation is low-risk and should be maximized.
- In high-stakes systems, supervision and redundancy must be designed, not assumed.
- The correct amount of automation depends on your downside tolerance.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **automation percentage**
- Start measuring: **recovery time and exception rate**
- Redesign: **automation with clear monitoring, fallbacks, and preserved understanding**

## Summary

Automation is leverage, but leverage amplifies failure. In the Money Flow Model, durable systems preserve trust and optionality by managing downside and keeping the ability to recover when the system exits the routine path.
