# Why Coordination Gets Paid More Than Labor

**Direct answer:** Coordination gets paid because it multiplies labor. One good coordinator can unlock the output of many workers by reducing confusion, conflict, and delay.
**Mechanism:** Coordination creates value by reducing friction and making outcomes predictable across people, which is exactly what money moves toward.
**Implication:** If you want higher income, learn to coordinate outcomes, not just execute tasks.

## Definitions

- **Labor:** direct execution of tasks.
- **Coordination:** aligning people, incentives, timelines, and standards.
- **Friction:** miscommunication, delay, rework, and conflict.
- **System:** a repeatable way to produce an outcome.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. A group without coordination wastes energy on rework and conflict.
2. Coordination reduces friction and increases predictability.
3. Therefore, coordination often produces a larger impact per unit of effort than execution.

## Where this breaks down

- Bad coordination adds bureaucracy and slows the system.
- Coordination without domain understanding becomes empty management.
- Small teams sometimes need more execution than coordination.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **personal productivity alone**
- Start measuring: **handoff quality, rework rate, and cycle time**
- Redesign: **work into clear interfaces, checklists, and decision rights**

## Summary

Coordination is a multiplier. It reduces friction and makes outcomes predictable across people. In the Money Flow Model, coordination is one of the simplest explanations for why some roles and businesses get paid far more than raw labor.
