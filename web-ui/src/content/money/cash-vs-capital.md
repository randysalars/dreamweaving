# Cash vs Capital

**Direct answer:** Cash is liquid optionality. Capital is any stored capability that can produce future outcomes (tools, systems, code, distribution, reputation).
**Mechanism:** Cash protects you from shocks, while capital produces compounding. They serve different jobs.
**Implication:** If you convert all cash into illiquid capital, you may become fragile even if you become "richer" on paper.

## Definitions

- **Cash:** the most liquid form of optionality.
- **Capital:** reusable capacity to create value in the future.
- **Liquidity risk:** inability to access resources when needed.
- **Runway:** time you can operate without new receipts.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Cash provides time and flexibility when the world changes.
2. Capital can multiply outcomes when paired with good judgment and distribution.
3. Therefore, durable wealth balances liquidity for survival with capital for compounding.

## Where this breaks down

- Holding too much cash can be costly if purchasing power erodes.
- Some "capital" is fragile because it depends on one counterparty or one regime.
- Illiquid assets can force you to sell at the worst time.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **net worth while ignoring liquidity**
- Start measuring: **runway and how quickly resources become usable**
- Redesign: **so you keep enough cash to avoid forced moves and enough capital to compound**

## Summary

Cash is liquidity. Capital is compounding capacity. Durable wealth uses both: cash to avoid forced choices, and capital to create value at scale. In the Money Flow Model, cash protects optionality while capital expands it.
