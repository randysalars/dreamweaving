# What Is Optionality?

**Direct answer:** Optionality is your ability to choose among survivable moves. It is flexibility under uncertainty.
**Mechanism:** Optionality matters because it prevents forced trades under stress, and forced trades usually happen at bad prices.
**Implication:** If you want wealth, increase options and reduce dependencies.

## Definitions

- **Optionality:** the menu of survivable moves available to you.
- **Dependency:** something that must go right for you to stay stable.
- **Runway:** time you can operate without new income.
- **Fragility:** sensitivity to shocks that cause irreversible loss.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Uncertainty creates shocks and opportunities.
2. Optionality provides time and flexibility to respond.
3. Therefore, optionality converts uncertainty into advantage instead of coercion.

## Where this breaks down

- Optionality can be confused with indecision. Options are only useful if you act.
- Options decay if you do not maintain skills and relationships.
- Some options are illusions if access is constrained (liquidity, gatekeepers).

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **short-term comfort at the expense of flexibility**
- Start measuring: **runway and dependency count**
- Redesign: **toward transferable skills, lower fixed costs, and multiple paths to income**

## Summary

Optionality is practical wealth: the ability to make moves without breaking. In the Money Flow Model, optionality is the outcome of risk control and surplus, and it is the mechanism that prevents forced choices when conditions change.
