# Income vs Wealth: Why High Earners Still Stay Poor

**Direct answer:** Income is what comes in. Wealth is what remains as optionality after expenses, obligations, and risk are accounted for.
**Mechanism:** High income does not create wealth because wealth requires surplus plus survivability. If your fixed costs rise with income, surplus disappears.
**Implication:** If you want wealth, design for low fragility and high surplus, not just higher receipts.

## Definitions

- **Income:** recurring inflow of money over time.
- **Wealth:** stored optionality and resilience.
- **Fixed costs:** obligations that do not flex down easily.
- **Surplus:** what remains after sustaining your life and commitments.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Income is a stream. It can be interrupted.
2. Wealth is a stock of options: cash, skills, relationships, and assets you can use.
3. Therefore, a high earner can be fragile if their lifestyle requires the stream to never stop.

## Where this breaks down

- A temporary income spike can hide structural fragility.
- Illiquid assets can create the illusion of wealth without usable options.
- Leverage can create high apparent wealth until a shock forces liquidation.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **status spending that locks in fixed costs**
- Start measuring: **savings rate, runway, and dependency count**
- Redesign: **your financial plan around survivability first, then compounding**

## Summary

Income is flow. Wealth is stored optionality. Wealth requires surplus plus survival through shocks. In the Money Flow Model, wealth emerges when value creation and leverage are paired with risk control and lifestyle design that protects optionality.
