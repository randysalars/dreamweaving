# What Is Wealth?

**Direct answer:** Wealth is stored optionality: the ability to make good moves over time without being forced by fear, debt, or fragility.
**Mechanism:** Wealth matters because it reduces forced choices, and forced choices usually come with bad terms and high stress.
**Implication:** You can increase income while losing wealth if you increase dependencies, obligations, or irreversible downside.

## Definitions

- **Wealth:** stored optionality across capital, skills, relationships, and time.
- **Income:** a flow of receipts; it can stop.
- **Net worth:** assets minus liabilities; a partial view of wealth.
- **Runway:** time you can operate without new income.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Life includes uncertainty: shocks, opportunities, and changing constraints.
2. Optionality gives you survivable choices during uncertainty.
3. Therefore, wealth is better measured by flexibility and resilience than by a single number.

## Where this breaks down

- Net worth can be illiquid. Paper wealth is not always usable wealth.
- Some assets create hidden liabilities (maintenance, taxes, attention).
- Wealth can be fragile if it depends on one market regime or one counterparty.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **headline income**
- Start measuring: **runway, dependency count, and irreversibility**
- Redesign: **your lifestyle so obligations do not consume your options**

## Summary

Wealth is stored optionality, not just cash or status. It is the ability to survive, pivot, and choose under stress. In the Money Flow Model, durable wealth comes from value creation, trust, leverage, and risk management that protects optionality.
