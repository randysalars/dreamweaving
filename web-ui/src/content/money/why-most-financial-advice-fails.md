# Why Most Financial Advice Fails

**Direct answer:** Most financial advice fails because it is generic. It ignores context, incentives, and the real constraint: risk, dependency, and decision quality under stress.
**Mechanism:** Advice fails when it treats money as tips instead of as a system where behavior, incentives, and survivability determine outcomes.
**Implication:** Use mechanisms and constraints, not slogans.

## Definitions

- **Context:** your constraints, obligations, skills, and risks.
- **Incentives:** what the advice-giver gains if you follow the advice.
- **Risk:** exposure to irreversible loss.
- **Optionality:** your set of survivable moves.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Two people can follow the same advice and get opposite outcomes due to different constraints.
2. Bad incentives produce advice that is optimized for selling, not for truth.
3. Therefore, mechanism-first models outperform generic tips.

## Where this breaks down

- Some advice is genuinely universal (avoid ruin, live below means, build skills).
- Even good advice can be mistimed if runway is low.
- Mechanisms can be misused as rationalizations if you avoid accountability.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **collecting tips**
- Start measuring: **constraints, incentives, and downside**
- Redesign: **your plan around survivability, leverage, and proof-based learning**

## Summary

Advice fails when it ignores context and incentives. Mechanisms scale because they explain why. In the Money Flow Model, the durable path is value creation, trust, leverage, optionality, and risk control, not hacks.
