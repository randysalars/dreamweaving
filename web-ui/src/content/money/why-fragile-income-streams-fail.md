# Why Fragile Income Streams Fail

**Direct answer:** Fragile income streams fail because they depend on one buyer, one channel, one skill, or one assumption staying true.
**Mechanism:** Fragility creates forced decisions when the dependency breaks, which often leads to bad deals, debt, or liquidation.
**Implication:** Build income like a bridge: redundancy, inspection, and multiple load paths.

## Definitions

- **Fragility:** sensitivity to shocks that cause large losses.
- **Dependency:** a single required condition (client, platform, employer, regulation).
- **Redundancy:** extra capacity or alternative paths.
- **Runway:** time you can survive without new receipts.

## The mechanism (why this works)

1. Every dependency has a failure mode.
2. When the failure happens, the person with no redundancy is forced to accept bad terms.
3. Therefore, fragility turns uncertainty into coercion.

## Where this breaks down

- Some income streams are stable due to strong contracts and trust.
- Over-diversifying can reduce focus and skill growth.
- Redundancy has a cost; optimize for resilience, not maximal complexity.

## Practical use (evergreen)

If you understand this model, you should:

- Stop optimizing: **one-channel growth without backups**
- Start measuring: **dependency count and time-to-replace a stream**
- Redesign: **toward multiple buyers, owned distribution, and transferable skills**

## Summary

Fragility is hidden until stress arrives. Durable wealth requires income that survives shocks and options that prevent forced moves. In the Money Flow Model, stability is an asset because it preserves optionality and protects compounding.
