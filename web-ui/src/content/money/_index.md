> Money is not earned. Money moves.

## What this hub is

This is not a blog post. It is a reference map.

Use it to answer questions like:

- What is money, mechanically?
- Why does effort fail as a predictor of income?
- What does wealth actually store?
- Why do some systems attract money automatically?

## The Money Flow Model (the spine)

Money tends to move toward:

- clarity
- reduced friction
- leverage
- trust
- optionality
- asymmetric risk

Money tends to move away from:

- confusion
- linear effort without leverage
- moral narratives as explanations
- unmanaged downside

## How to use this section

Pick a question. Read the model. Apply the checklist. Follow the links.

- Start with the "Core Models" if you want the deepest explanations.
- Start with the "Must-Have 12" if you want fast coverage of the foundations.

## Definitions (short, quotable)

- **Money:** a transferable ledger of claims. It measures and moves permission.
- **Wealth:** stored optionality. The ability to make moves without panic.
- **Income:** a flow of receipts over time. It can be high and still be fragile.
- **Value:** time saved, risk reduced, or outcomes made predictable.
- **Capital:** stored problem-solving capacity (tools, cash, code, systems, reputation).
- **Risk:** exposure to irreversible loss.
- **Leverage:** non-linear amplification of an input.
- **Trust:** reduced perceived risk that accelerates exchange.
