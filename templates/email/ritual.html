    <!-- SEASONAL_REFLECTION: Content that marks the sacred season
         This section acknowledges the emotional/spiritual weight of the moment.
         Guidelines:
         - Name the season without forcing celebration
         - Acknowledge the complexity of seasonal feelings
         - Offer permission, not expectation
         - Never sell in ritual emails

RITUAL EMAIL GUIDELINES
========================

These are the most powerful emails you will ever send.

Subject Line Options:
- As the season turns
- A moment for this time of year
- On entering this season
- For [Season Name]

Seasonal Occasions:
- Advent (late November/early December)
- Christmas (December 24-25)
- New Year (December 31 - January 1)
- Lent (varies, ~40 days before Easter)
- Easter (varies)
- All Souls / Remembrance (early November)
- Solstices (June 21, December 21)
- Equinoxes (March 20, September 22)

Critical Rules:
- NEVER sell in ritual emails
- These anchor emotional memory to Dreamweaver
- They exist to mark time, not to convert
- They create the trust that makes later invitations feel safe

Sample Advent Reflection:
"As this season arrives, many people feel pressure to mark it loudly.
To explain it. To perform it. To keep pace with it.
But some moments are meant to be entered quietly.
If you're carrying weariness, you don't need to resolve it.
If you're carrying hope, you don't need to defend it.
Let this season be what it is.
Let yourself be where you are."

Sample Blessing:
"May light arrive gently.
May rest be allowed.
May meaning come without force."

Signature Variations:
- "Holding you in this moment"
- "Walking with you through this season"
- "In the quiet with you"
