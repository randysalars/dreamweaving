    <!-- OFFERING_DESCRIPTION: Brief, non-pushy description
         Guidelines:
         - Describe who it's for, not what it is
         - Use "for those who..." framing
         - Focus on the inner state it serves
         - 2-3 sentences maximum
    -->
    {{OFFERING_DESCRIPTION}}

    <p>There's no urgency.<br>
    No expectation.</p>

    <div class="link-container">
      <p>If it feels like something you'd like to spend time with, you can find it here:</p>
      <p><a href="{{OFFERING_URL}}" class="gentle-link">{{OFFERING_LINK_TEXT}}</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>If not, that's completely okay.<br>
    These letters will continue either way.</p>

INVITATION EMAIL GUIDELINES
============================

Use sparingly — only after trust is established.

Subject Line Options:
- An invitation, if it serves you
- Something that may meet you where you are
- A quiet offering

Structural Rules:
- ONE link only
- Never scarcity-based
- No fake deadlines
- No manipulation
- Language preserves dignity and choice

Key Insight:
Invitation emails work BECAUSE of all the emails that didn't ask for anything.

Sample Offering Descriptions:

For a Dreamweaving:
"It's a Dreamweaving created for those who've been feeling stretched thin —
a guided inner journey focused on rest, meaning, and return."

For a seasonal collection:
"This is a collection of four Dreamweavings for the winter season —
for those seeking quiet companionship through the darker months."

For a course/program:
"This is a series of guided practices for those who want to rebuild
their relationship with their inner life — slowly, without pressure."

Variables:
- {{OFFERING_DESCRIPTION}} - 2-3 sentences about who it serves
- {{OFFERING_URL}} - The link to the offering
- {{OFFERING_LINK_TEXT}} - Text for the link (e.g., "View the Dreamweaving")

Frequency Rules:
- Maximum 1 invitation email per month
- Only after at least 2 correspondence emails
- Never back-to-back invitations
