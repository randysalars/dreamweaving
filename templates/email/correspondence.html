    <!-- MAIN_REFLECTION: The core reflection content
         This section should be 3-5 paragraphs of gentle, reflective prose.
         Guidelines:
         - Open with an observation or shared human experience
         - Explore the theme without prescribing solutions
         - Use "we" and "many people" rather than "you should"
         - Close with permission, not instruction
    -->
    {{MAIN_REFLECTION}}

    <p>If this reflection meets you where you are, take it with you.<br>
    If not, let it pass gently.</p>

    <p class="signature">Until next time,<br>
    — Dreamweaver</p>

CORRESPONDENCE EMAIL GUIDELINES
================================

Subject Line Options:
- A thought I wanted to share
- A quiet reflection
- For those carrying a lot lately
- Something I've been sitting with

Content Rules:
- No calls to action
- No links unless absolutely necessary
- No selling, ever
- Designed to be reply-worthy
- Timeless (can be archived and reread)

Cadence:
- Every 7-14 days maximum
- Irregular but consistent
- Never daily
- Never algorithm-driven

Sample Reflection Structure:
1. Opening observation (what you've noticed)
2. Shared human experience (many people feel...)
3. Gentle exploration (perhaps... maybe...)
4. Permission or blessing (you don't have to...)

Example Themes:
- Carrying more than we were meant to
- The radical act of pausing
- When meaning arrives as permission to rest
- The inner life becoming crowded
- Noticing what is asking to be tended
