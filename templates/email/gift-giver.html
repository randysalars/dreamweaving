    <p>It will be delivered at the time you chose, quietly and respectfully.<br>
    Nothing more is required from you.</p>

    <p>Gifts like this matter more than we often realize.<br>
    They create space.<br>
    They offer rest.<br>
    They remind someone they're not alone.</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing to give in this way.</p>

GIFT-GIVER EMAIL GUIDELINES
============================

Sent immediately after someone purchases a gift for another person.

Subject Line Options:
- Your gift has been received
- Thank you for your generosity
- Your gift is ready

Purpose:
- Confirm the transaction
- Affirm the meaning of their action
- Plant seed for potential self-subscription

Variables:
- {{GIFT_NAME}} - Name of the Dreamweaving or collection
- {{RECIPIENT_NAME}} - Name of person receiving the gift
- {{DELIVERY_DATE}} - When the gift will be delivered

Important:
- Gift-givers often become future customers themselves
- This email should feel dignified, not transactional
- No upsells, no "you might also like"
- The tone should make them proud of their choice

Secondary Conversion Path:
After sending this email, the giver receives:
1. A gentle invitation to subscribe (not sell)
2. Future correspondence emails
3. Often purchases for themselves later
