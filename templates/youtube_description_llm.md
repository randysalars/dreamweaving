## 🔮 What is Dreamweaving?

Dreamweaving is a mythic-spiritual immersion system that combines:
- Guided meditative storytelling
- Archetypal psychology + symbolic pathworking
- Ancient traditions ({LINEAGE})
- Modern consciousness technologies ({FREQUENCY_TYPE} entrainment, binaural beats)
- Ritual frameworks (journeys, gates, activations)

Each Dreamweaver Journey follows a sacred 4-stage ceremony:
1. **Opening the Gate** — grounding, breathwork, resonance alignment
2. **Descent into the Realm** — arrival into the mythic environment
3. **Activation or Encounter** — symbolic initiation, archetype contact
4. **Return & Integration** — closing the gate, embodying insights
