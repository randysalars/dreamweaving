  notes: |
    Key elements for sleep sessions:
    - Counting down/deepening
    - Body scan relaxation
    - Heavy/sinking sensations
    - Soft, dreamy imagery
    - Progressive muscle relaxation
    - Breath focus
    - Let go of thoughts

    Important: Voice should gradually
    become quieter and slower toward
    the end of the session.
