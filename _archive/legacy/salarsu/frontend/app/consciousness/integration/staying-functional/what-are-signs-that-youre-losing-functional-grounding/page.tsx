              Why This Matters
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Loss of functional grounding occurs because heightened awareness states can overwhelm cognitive processing capacity, making ordinary tasks feel impossibly complex. This results from attention becoming too diffuse or internally focused, which disrupts the automatic mental processes that handle daily functioning. The disconnection from practical concerns demonstrates that consciousness shifts can destabilize the mental frameworks that organize routine behavior and decision-making.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The severity varies based on the intensity and duration of awareness changes, with some people maintaining basic functioning while others experience complete disorientation. Those with prior meditation or altered state experience often retain more grounding skills.
