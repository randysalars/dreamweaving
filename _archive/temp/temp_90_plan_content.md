Below is a 90-page publishing plan engineered as a decision-intelligence system, not a blog calendar.

It is ordered by conversion leverage first, authority compounding second, and AI/search capture third—so pages you publish early actively support pages you publish later.

This is built so Salars.net never competes with encyclopedias and instead becomes a thinking partner for buyers.

---

# 🧭 THE STRUCTURE (READ FIRST)

The 90 pages are divided into 9 clusters × 10 pages each.

Each cluster:

- Targets a distinct buyer intent
- Has internal linking within the cluster
- Funnels into products + newsletter
- Builds language that compounds authority

# 🧱 INTERNAL LINKING RULES (CRITICAL)

Every page should:

- Link upward to a cluster pillar
- Link sideways to 2 related pages
- Link forward to 1 product or category
- Optionally link to How to Buy Coins Without Regret
This creates a self-reinforcing authority loop.

---

# 🕰️ PUBLISHING RHYTHM (REALISTIC)

- 3 pages/week → 30 weeks
- Or 1 page/day → 90 days
- Or 10 pages/month → 9 months
Even unfinished clusters work once the spine is live.

---

# 🎯 WHAT THIS SYSTEM DOES

✅ Attracts high-intent buyers

✅ Converts supplies naturally

✅ Feeds AI answer engines

✅ Builds unique language & authority

✅ Avoids big-site competition entirely

✅ Turns Salars.net into a thinking guide

---

## NEXT OPTIONAL STEPS

I can:

- Prioritize Top 15 “money pages” to publish first
- Turn this into a Notion / CSV / Kanban plan
- Create article templates for fast writing
- Design knowledge → email → product loops
- Build an AI-first FAQ extraction system
Tell me which one you want next and I’ll take it all the way down to implementation.
