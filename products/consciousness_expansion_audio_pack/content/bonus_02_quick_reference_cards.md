# Card 12: The Core Truth

**You are not your thoughts.**
Thoughts happen. You watch them.

**You are not your emotions.**
Emotions happen. You experience them.

**You are not your body.**
The body happens. You inhabit it.

**You are not your story.**
The story happens. You tell it.

**You are awareness itself.**
Everything happens within you.

**You have always been this.**
You will always be this.

**The practice is remembering.**
