# 30-Day Consciousness Challenge

## Transform Your Mind in One Month

---

# Welcome to the Challenge

This 30-day challenge takes you through a progressive consciousness expansion curriculum. Each day builds on the previous, creating compound transformation.

**Rules of the Challenge:**

1. **Do not skip days.** If you miss one, do it the next day before continuing.
2. **Complete the daily practice before checking your phone or email.**
3. **Journal briefly each night.** Even one sentence counts.
4. **Tell no one you're doing this** (optional but powerful—the energy stays internal).
5. **Trust the process.** Day 15 feels different than day 3.
