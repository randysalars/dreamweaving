# METRICS TO TRACK (Anti-Vanity)
# =============================================================================

good_metrics:
  # These tell us if we're building real relationships

  reply_rate:
    description: "Percentage of subscribers who have ever replied"
    why_it_matters: "Replies indicate genuine connection, not just consumption"
    target: ">3%"
    calculation: "subscribers_who_replied / total_subscribers * 100"
    note: "This is our TRUE north star metric"

  return_rate:
    description: "Subscribers who return after 60+ day absence"
    why_it_matters: "Shows content has lasting value, not just novelty"
    target: ">10% of inactive"
    calculation: "returned_after_absence / subscribers_60day_inactive * 100"

  repeat_purchase_rate:
    description: "Buyers who purchase again"
    why_it_matters: "Indicates product delivers real value"
    target: ">25%"
    calculation: "purchasers_with_2plus / total_purchasers * 100"

  deep_scroll_rate:
    description: "Article visitors who scroll >70%"
    why_it_matters: "Shows content is worth reading, not just clicking"

  organic_referral_rate:
    description: "New subscribers from word-of-mouth"
    why_it_matters: "Best subscribers come from people who love you"
    target: ">15%"

  subscriber_longevity:
    description: "Average subscription duration before unsubscribe"
    why_it_matters: "Long tenure = sustained value"
    target: ">12 months"
    calculation: "avg(unsubscribe_date - subscribe_date)"

bad_metrics:
  # These can mislead us into manipulation

  open_rate:
    why_its_misleading: "Apple privacy inflates it. Doesn't indicate connection."
    note: "Track for hygiene only, don't optimize for it"

  click_through_rate:
    why_its_misleading: "We rarely include links. Low CTR is intentional."
    note: "Only relevant for invitation emails"

  raw_subscriber_count:
    why_its_misleading: "100 engaged > 10,000 passive"
    note: "Quality over quantity, always"

  virality_metrics:
    why_its_misleading: "Viral content often attracts wrong audience"
    note: "Slow organic growth is healthier"

  conversion_speed:
    why_its_misleading: "Fast conversion often means premature selling"
    note: "6-month journey is healthy, not a problem"

  implementation: |
    Before any metric optimization, ask:
    - Does this help us serve our community better?
    - Does this respect the trust they've placed in us?
    - Would we be proud to explain this to our most loyal subscriber?

    If the answer to any is "no", don't do it.
