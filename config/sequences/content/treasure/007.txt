Subject: The Stories That Objects Hold

Hello,

I was sitting in my study the other day, holding a small, chipped ceramic bird that once belonged to my grandmother. It’s not worth much in a monetary sense—maybe a dollar or two at a flea market. But as I turned it over in my hands, I could almost hear her voice telling me how she bought it on a whim during a trip to the coast, how it reminded her of the freedom she felt watching gulls soar over the ocean. That little bird isn’t just an object; it’s a vessel for her story, her joy, her memory. And I wonder—what objects in your life carry stories like that?

We often think of treasure as something shiny or rare, something with a price tag that turns heads. But I’ve come to see that the true value of any “find” lies in the history it holds, the meaning we weave into it. A rusted key from an old house, a worn book with notes in the margins, a pebble picked up on a walk with someone you love—these things aren’t treasures because of what they are, but because of what they mean. Many people carry this quietly, this unspoken connection to the small, seemingly ordinary things that anchor their lives. You’re not strange for feeling this pull.

If you’ve ever held onto something that others might call clutter, know that this doesn’t mean something is wrong. It’s not about hoarding or sentimentality run amok—it’s about recognizing the invisible threads of story that tie us to our past, to each other. You don’t have to justify keeping that old ticket stub or that faded photograph. Nor do you have to fix this attachment immediately, as if it’s a problem to solve. Maybe it’s enough to just notice what these objects stir in you, to let them speak their quiet truths.

I’d love to hear, if you feel like sharing, about an object in your life that holds a story. What makes it a treasure to you? There’s no rush to reply, no expectation—just an open invitation to reflect. In Dreamweaving, we often explore how these personal histories shape the way we create and connect, but even if you never join us in that space, I hope this moment of pause feels like a small gift.

With peace,  
Randy
