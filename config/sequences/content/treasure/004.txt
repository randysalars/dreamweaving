Subject: Digging Deeper for What Matters

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about how often the things we treasure most in life aren’t sitting on the surface, waiting to be picked up. They’re buried—sometimes under layers of doubt, distraction, or just the sheer weight of time. Finding them asks something of us: persistence. Not the loud, forceful kind, but the quiet, steady kind that shows up even when the ground feels hard and unyielding. I wonder if you’ve ever felt that pull to keep going, even when the first few tries turned up nothing.

Many people carry this quietly—the sense that what they’re searching for is just out of reach, hidden beneath the obvious. You’re not strange for feeling this. It doesn’t mean something is wrong if the answers or the beauty or the meaning you’re after hasn’t revealed itself yet. Life, like the earth, often guards its treasures well. It’s not a punishment; it’s an invitation to dig deeper, to bring a little more of yourself to the search. I’ve found, in my own stumbles, that the act of persisting often teaches us more than the treasure itself.

What if the digging is the point? Not just to unearth something shiny, but to know yourself better in the process. Each layer you move through—each frustration, each quiet moment of resolve—shapes you. I’m not saying you have to keep going if you’re exhausted; rest is as much a part of persistence as effort. I’m only offering that you don’t have to see empty hands as failure. They’re just a sign you’re still in the story.

If you’re in a season of searching, whether it’s for clarity, connection, or something you can’t quite name, give yourself room to keep at it in your own way. You don’t have to fix this immediately or force the ground to give up its secrets. Sometimes, the treasure isn’t a thing at all—it’s the person you become while you’re looking.

With peace,  
Randy
