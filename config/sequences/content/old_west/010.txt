Subject: A Final Word on True Independence

Hello,

As we come to the end of this Old West journey together, I want to sit with you for a moment on the idea of independence—not the loud, brash kind we often imagine, but the quiet, steady kind that a pioneer might have carried under wide skies. It’s not about standing alone or rejecting help. It’s about knowing your own ground, even when the world feels unsteady. You’re not strange for craving that kind of rootedness in a time when everything seems to pull us outward.

Many people carry this quietly—a longing to build something that’s theirs, to live by a compass they’ve set for themselves. I’ve felt it too, looking out at a horizon of endless noise and wondering how to carve out a space that feels like home. This doesn’t mean something is wrong with you or the world. It just means you’re listening to a deeper call, one that asks you to remember who you are when the dust settles.

Independence in a modern world isn’t about riding off into the sunset, though that image has its charm. It’s about small, deliberate acts—choosing where to place your time, your trust, your heart. It’s about knowing you don’t have to fix this immediately or have all the answers today. You can take a slow step, then another, building a life that feels like yours, even if it’s just a quiet corner at first. I’ve learned that the pioneer spirit isn’t in the grand gesture; it’s in the stubborn, gentle choice to keep going your way.

So as we part ways on this trail, I hope you carry that spirit with you—not as a burden, but as a lantern. Let it light what’s true for you, at your own pace. I’m grateful to have shared this stretch of the journey, and I’m here if you ever want to walk a little further together.

With peace,  
Randy
