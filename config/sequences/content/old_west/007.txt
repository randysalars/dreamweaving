Subject: The Wisdom of the Land

Hello,

Out here in the Old West of my imagination, the land speaks if you’re quiet enough to listen. It’s not a voice of words, but of cycles—seasons that turn without rush, rivers that carve their paths over centuries, and winds that shape stone with a patience we can barely fathom. I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately, how nature doesn’t hurry, yet everything gets done. There’s a profound respect in that, a reminder that we don’t control the rhythm of the earth, only our response to it.

Many people carry a quiet tension about time, feeling out of step with the world’s demands to speed up, produce more, move faster. You’re not strange for feeling this. The land doesn’t judge you for pausing to notice a sunset or for taking the long way home just to feel the air on your face. It doesn’t measure your worth by how much you’ve done today. Instead, it invites you to witness its slow, deliberate way of being—a way that has sustained itself long before we arrived and will continue long after we’re gone.

I’ve found that respecting nature’s cycles often means respecting our own. Some days, we’re the rushing river; others, we’re the stone waiting to be shaped. This doesn’t mean something is wrong. You don’t have to fix this immediately or force yourself into a pace that feels unnatural. What might it look like to let yourself align with a slower current, even for a little while? I’m not here to tell you how, just to say it’s okay to wonder.

Dreamweaving, at its heart, is about noticing these rhythms—both in the world around us and within ourselves. If you’ve been walking this Old West trail with me, I hope you’ve felt a bit of that permission to slow down, to listen to what the land, and your own spirit, might be saying. I’m grateful to share this space with you, wherever you are on your journey.

With peace,  
Randy
