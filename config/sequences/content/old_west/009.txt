Subject: The Myth and the Reality of the Old West

Hello,

As we near the end of this journey through the Old West, I’ve been thinking about the stories we tell ourselves—about history, about struggle, about what it means to be “tough” or “free.” Hollywood has painted the West as a place of endless gunfights, stoic cowboys, and clear-cut heroes and villains. But the reality, as I’ve come to see it, is far messier, far more human. I wonder if you’ve ever felt caught between a myth you’ve been told and a truth that feels heavier to carry.

The West wasn’t just showdowns at high noon. It was families scraping by on homesteads, indigenous communities fighting to hold onto their way of life, and towns built on the back of quiet, grueling labor. The “freedom” of the cowboy often meant loneliness, long stretches of silence, and the weight of survival. I’ve read accounts of ranch hands who wrote letters home, aching for connection, not glory. Many people carry this quietly—the gap between the romanticized version of a story and the lived experience. You’re not strange for feeling this in your own life, where the ideals you’ve been sold don’t match the ground beneath your feet.

This doesn’t mean something is wrong with the stories we love or the history we inherit. It’s more about noticing where the myth overshadows the reality, and giving yourself permission to see both. The West teaches us that grit isn’t always loud or dramatic—it’s often in the small, persistent choices to keep going, even when the horizon feels out of reach. You don’t have to fix this tension immediately, or even resolve it. Sometimes, just holding both truths is enough.

I hope this series has offered you a chance to reflect on your own stories—the myths you’ve been told about success or strength, and the realities you’ve lived. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from studying the West, it’s that the real courage lies in facing what’s true, not just what’s shiny. I’m grateful to share this space with you as we walk through these ideas together.

With peace,  
Randy
