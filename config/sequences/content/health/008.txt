Subject: Stress as a Teacher

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about stress lately—not as an enemy to defeat, but as a teacher we’re meant to sit with, even if the lessons are uncomfortable. So often, we’re told to eliminate stress, to banish it from our lives as if it’s a flaw in the system. But I’ve come to see it differently. Stress isn’t just a burden; it’s a signal, a way our body and mind point us toward what needs attention. You’re not strange for feeling it, even if it lingers longer than you’d like.

Resilience, I’ve learned, isn’t about making stress disappear. It’s about learning to dance with it—finding a rhythm where you can move without breaking. Some days, that dance feels clumsy, like you’ve got two left feet. Other days, you might find a surprising grace in how you carry it. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if stress feels heavy right now. It just means you’re human, navigating a world that asks a lot of you. Many people carry this quietly, and there’s no need to rush toward a fix.

What if, just for a moment, you let stress be a guide instead of a threat? Maybe it’s pointing to a boundary you need to set, a rest you’ve been postponing, or a deeper truth you’ve been too busy to hear. I’m not saying you have to solve it all today. You don’t have to fix this immediately. Just notice it. Let it speak. Over time, I’ve found that this kind of listening builds a quiet strength—a resilience that doesn’t shout but holds steady.

I hope you can give yourself permission to meet stress on your own terms, in your own time. If there’s a way I can support you through Dreamweaving or just by listening, I’m here. Until then, take a breath when you can.

With peace,
Randy
