Subject: The Quiet Healing of Nature

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about how often we underestimate the simplest medicine available to us: the natural world. There’s a practice from Japan called Shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing, which isn’t about getting wet but about immersing yourself in the atmosphere of a forest. It’s slow, deliberate, and quiet—just being among trees, breathing their air, listening to their rustle. Studies show it lowers stress hormones, boosts mood, and even strengthens immunity. But I suspect you don’t need a study to feel the truth of this. Many people carry this quietly, a deep knowing that nature restores something in us we can’t quite name.

When I’m feeling frayed or overthought, I step outside. Not to hike or achieve anything, but to stand still under a canopy of leaves or sit by a stream. There’s a biological necessity to this contact—our bodies and minds evolved with the earth, not with screens or concrete. We’re wired to respond to green, to the scent of soil, to the fractal patterns of branches. You’re not strange for feeling this pull, even if you’ve never named it. It doesn’t mean something is wrong if you’ve drifted from it, either. Life pulls us indoors, into busyness, and that’s just how it goes sometimes.

I wonder if you’ve had a moment like this—a time when nature seemed to hold you, even briefly. Maybe it was a park bench under an old oak, or a childhood memory of running through tall grass. If it’s been a while, that’s okay. You don’t have to fix this immediately or plan some grand wilderness escape. Start where you are. Step outside for five minutes. Notice one tree, one bird, one breath of fresh air. Let that be enough for now.

Nature doesn’t rush, and neither do you have to. It’s there, waiting, whenever you’re ready to meet it again. I’ve found that even a small reconnection can shift something inside, like a quiet reminder of who we are beneath all the noise.

With peace,  
Randy
