Subject: A Quiet Permission to Be Human

Hello,

As I sit to write this, I’m thinking about the way life moves—how it carries us through seasons of strength and seasons of fragility, often without warning. Health, I’ve come to see, isn’t a destination we arrive at and stay. It’s a winding path, sometimes smooth and sometimes jagged, and none of us escape the inevitability of illness or aging. You’re not strange for feeling the weight of this. Many people carry it quietly, wondering if they’re alone in noticing the body’s whispers or shouts.

I’ve watched my own body change over the years—small aches that linger longer, a tiredness that wasn’t there before. I’ve also watched loved ones navigate their own health journeys, some with grace, others with frustration. What I’ve learned is this: it’s okay to feel whatever you feel about your health. Anger, fear, acceptance, or even a stubborn refusal to slow down—none of these make you wrong. This doesn’t mean something is wrong with *you*. It just means you’re human, living in a body that’s as imperfect and beautiful as the rest of life.

If you’re facing a health challenge right now, or if you’re simply noticing the slow creep of time, I want to offer you a quiet permission: you don’t have to fix this immediately. You don’t have to be stronger than you feel or braver than you are. You can take your time to listen to what your body needs, to grieve what’s changed if you need to, or to simply sit with it all. Health isn’t a race or a checklist—it’s a conversation, one that evolves day by day.

I hope, as you move through your own journey, that you find moments of gentleness for yourself. That you remember you’re not alone in this very human experience. I’m here, too, walking my own path, and I’m rooting for you in whatever way feels true to you.

With peace,  
Randy
