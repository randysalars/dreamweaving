Subject: The Mirror in the Machine

Hello,

There is a strange sensation that comes with using modern artificial intelligence—a feeling of looking into a mirror that isn't quite a mirror.

When we talk to these machines, we often think we are exploring the boundaries of technology. But more often than not, we are simply exploring the boundaries of ourselves. 

AI reflects our own biases, our hopes for a faster future, and our fears of being replaced. It acts as a prism, refracting the vast sum of human knowledge back at us in ways that can be both enlightening and deeply unsettling.

In this "Slow Business" approach I’ve been practicing, I’ve found that the real value of AI isn't in how fast it can "do" something for us, but in how it invites us to reconsider what "doing" even means. If a machine can write a perfect paragraph in a second, then the value of that paragraph must lie somewhere beyond the words themselves—it must lie in the intent, the connection, and the human "why" behind it.

Take a moment today to look at the tools you use. Are they mirrors for your ambition, or prisms for your curiosity?

Understanding these machines is, I believe, one of the most direct paths we currently have to understanding what it means to be human.

Be well,
