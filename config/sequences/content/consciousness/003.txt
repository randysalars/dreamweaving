Subject: The Wisdom in Your Body

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about how often we lean on our minds to solve everything—how we analyze, strategize, and try to think our way through life’s complexities. There’s a certain comfort in that, isn’t there? The intellect feels like a tool we can control. But lately, I’ve been reminded of something quieter, something deeper: the wisdom of the body. It’s a kind of knowing that doesn’t come with words or logic, but with a felt sense—a hum, a tightness, a release.

Many people carry this quietly, this subtle language of the body, without ever naming it. You might notice it in the way your chest tightens when something feels off, or how your shoulders soften when you’re truly at ease. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you haven’t tuned into it before. It’s not a skill you’re supposed to have mastered. It’s more like a conversation that’s always been happening, waiting for you to listen when you’re ready. You don’t have to fix this immediately or force yourself to “get it.” Just noticing is enough for now.

I’ve found, in my own slow unraveling, that the body often knows things before the mind catches up. It’s not about ignoring thought or analysis, but about letting them sit alongside this other kind of intelligence. When I started Dreamweaving, I was so caught up in ideas—how to create, how to share, how to explain. But it was only when I paused and felt into the work, letting my hands and heart guide me, that it began to take shape. There’s a grounding in that, a trust that doesn’t need to rush or prove itself.

So, if you feel called to, take a moment today to notice what your body might be saying. Not with pressure or expectation, but with curiosity. Maybe it’s a whisper in your gut, or a heaviness in your limbs. You’re not strange for feeling this, or for not quite understanding it yet. There’s no hurry to figure it out. Just let it be there, as it is.

With peace,  
Randy
