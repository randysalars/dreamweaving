Subject: On Being a Beginner (Again)

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about what it means to start over—to approach something with fresh eyes, even when you’ve been at it for years. There’s a quiet power in the beginner’s mind, a kind of freedom that comes from not knowing all the answers. I’ve felt this myself, stepping into new layers of Dreamweaving or even revisiting old practices with a sense of wonder. It’s humbling, and sometimes uncomfortable, but it’s also a reminder that growth doesn’t always mean mastering something—it can mean unlearning and beginning again.

You might feel this too, in moments where you’re called to rethink how you show up in your work, your relationships, or even in the quiet space of your own thoughts. Many people carry this quietly—the sense that they should already “know” how to do something, or that starting over is a step backward. But this doesn’t mean something is wrong. Being a beginner again isn’t a failure; it’s an invitation. It’s permission to let go of the weight of expectation and to meet yourself exactly where you are.

There’s a lightness in not having to have it all figured out. When I first started weaving dreams into something tangible, I didn’t know the “right” way to do it. I still don’t, some days. And yet, that uncertainty has often been the doorway to the deepest insights. You don’t have to fix this immediately—whatever “this” is for you. You don’t have to rush to become an expert in your own unfolding. What if, just for today, you let yourself be curious instead?

I’m not here to tell you how to embrace a beginner’s mind, because your way will be your own. But I do want to say: you’re not strange for feeling this pull to start anew, to question, to explore. There’s room for that. There’s always room to begin again, no matter how far along you think you are.

With peace,
Randy
