Subject: Curiosity Without a Purpose

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about the things we learn just because they call to us—those little pockets of knowledge or skills that don’t seem to “do” anything practical. Maybe it’s memorizing the phases of the moon, learning to identify birds by their songs, or diving into the history of a forgotten craft. There’s a quiet joy in chasing something useless, isn’t there? Not useless in a bad way, but in a freeing one—curiosity without an agenda.

I remember spending hours as a kid trying to whistle through a blade of grass. I wasn’t good at it, and it didn’t matter. There was no test to pass, no one to impress. It was just me, the grass, and the stubborn hope of a sound. Looking back, I see how those moments shaped me—not because they led to anything tangible, but because they taught me to value the act of wondering. You’re not strange for having your own version of this, whether it’s doodling patterns in a notebook or getting lost in obscure documentaries. Many people carry this quietly, a private delight that doesn’t need to justify itself.

What if we gave ourselves permission to lean into these things more often? Not to turn them into a side hustle or a productivity hack, but to let them be what they are—small, sacred acts of being human. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you’ve set these aside for a while; life gets heavy, and priorities shift. But if there’s a whisper of curiosity tugging at you, you don’t have to fix this immediately or make it a big deal. Just notice it. Maybe spend five minutes today with something that lights you up for no reason at all.

I’d love to hear what “useless” thing has ever captured your attention, if you feel like sharing. Or maybe just take a moment to remember it for yourself. Either way, I’m glad we’re in this space together, where slowness and wonder aren’t just allowed, but cherished.

With peace,  
Randy
