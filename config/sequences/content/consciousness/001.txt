Subject: The Quiet Art of Unlearning

Hello,

There’s a certain weight to the ideas we’ve carried for years—mental models, beliefs, and ways of seeing the world that once felt like anchors, grounding us. But over time, some of these anchors can start to feel more like chains. They hold us in patterns that no longer fit who we’re becoming. I’ve noticed this in my own life, and I suspect you might have too. Unlearning isn’t about erasing the past; it’s about gently loosening our grip on what no longer serves us, making space for something new to emerge.

Many people carry this quietly—the subtle ache of knowing something needs to shift but not quite knowing how to begin. You’re not strange for feeling this. Unlearning isn’t a loud or dramatic process. It’s often a quiet one, a slow unraveling. It might start with a question: What if I didn’t have to see this the same way anymore? Or it might come as a moment of pause, where you catch yourself reacting out of habit and wonder if there’s another way. There’s no rush to figure it out. This doesn’t mean something is wrong—it just means you’re growing.

I’ve come to see unlearning as an art, not a task. It’s not about forcing yourself to let go or bulldozing old beliefs to make room for “better” ones. It’s more like tending a garden—pulling weeds not out of anger, but out of care for what wants to grow. You don’t have to fix this immediately. Sometimes, simply noticing what feels heavy is enough for now. That noticing is the first step, and it’s braver than it seems.

If you’re feeling this pull to unlearn, to question, to make space, I’m here walking a similar path. Over the next few emails, I’ll share more about how consciousness—our awareness of ourselves and the world—can be a guide in this process. For today, I just wanted to sit with you in this idea: growth often begins not with learning something new, but with releasing something old. Let that land however it does for you.

With peace,  
Randy
