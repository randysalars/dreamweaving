Subject: The Language of Your Needs

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about how hard it can be to say what we need in love—whether it’s with a partner, a friend, or even within ourselves. We often worry that naming a desire will sound like a demand, or worse, a criticism. So we hold back, hoping the other person will just *know*. But unspoken needs don’t disappear; they linger, sometimes turning into quiet resentment or a sense of being unseen. You’re not strange for feeling this tension. Many people carry this quietly.

There’s a language to needs, though, that doesn’t have to carry blame or expectation. It starts with noticing what you’re longing for—maybe it’s more time together, or a deeper kind of listening, or simply to feel safe being yourself. Instead of framing it as something someone else *should* give, try speaking it as a window into your heart: “I’ve been missing this kind of closeness,” or “I feel most connected when we share these moments.” It’s not about fixing or forcing—it’s about revealing. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if the other person can’t meet you there. It just means you’ve been brave enough to name what matters to you.

I’ve stumbled through this myself, learning that the act of speaking a need is often less about the outcome and more about honoring my own truth. Sometimes the other person hears me in a new way; sometimes they don’t. Either way, I’m no longer carrying the weight of the unsaid. You don’t have to fix this immediately or get it perfect. Just start where you are, with a single honest sentence, and see what opens up.

If this feels heavy or uncertain, that’s okay. Give yourself room to feel your way through it. I’m here, reflecting on these things alongside you, and I believe there’s power in even the smallest step toward clarity.

With peace,  
Randy
