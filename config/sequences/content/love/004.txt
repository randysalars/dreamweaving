Subject: The Quiet Power of Deep Listening

Hello,

I’ve been thinking lately about how rare it is to be truly heard. Not just listened to in passing, or with half an ear while someone waits for their turn to speak, but deeply, fully heard—where the other person sets aside their own noise to be with you in that moment. It’s a kind of presence that feels almost sacred when it happens. And I wonder, when was the last time you felt that? Or offered it?

Deep listening isn’t about solving anything. It’s not about having the right words or fixing what’s been said. It’s about creating a space where someone can unfold, even just for a minute, without fear of judgment or interruption. I’ve noticed in my own life how often I’ve rushed to respond, to fill the silence with something—anything—rather than let it sit. But when I’ve managed to stay quiet, to really hear, something shifts. The other person softens, or sometimes they say something they didn’t even know they needed to. You’re not strange for craving this kind of connection, or for finding it hard to give. Many people carry this quietly, this longing to be seen through sound.

If you’ve ever felt unheard, or if you’ve struggled to listen without agenda, this doesn’t mean something is wrong. It’s just a sign of how busy and distracted our lives can be, how much we’re often carrying. You don’t have to fix this immediately, or become a perfect listener overnight. But maybe there’s a small moment today—over coffee, on a call, or even in a passing conversation—where you can pause. Where you can let the other person’s words land, without rushing to shape them. I’ve found that even a few seconds of real presence can change the air between two people.

I’m not here to tell you how to do this, or to suggest it’s easy. I just wanted to share this thought, because I believe listening is one of the most powerful ways we can show love—not the loud, dramatic kind, but the quiet, steady kind. If this resonates, let it sit with you. If it doesn’t, that’s okay too.

With peace,  
Randy
