Subject: On Letting Go and Holding Fast

Hello,

There’s a quiet tension in love, isn’t there? The pull to hold on, to keep close what matters most, and the equally strong need to let go, to allow space for growth—yours and theirs. I’ve felt this in my own life, watching something or someone I cherish slip through my fingers, not because of loss, but because clinging too tightly can sometimes smother what’s meant to breathe. I wonder if you’ve felt this too, the ache of wanting to protect and the wisdom of stepping back.

Many people carry this quietly, this dance between attachment and freedom. It’s not strange to feel torn, to question whether you’re doing love “right” when you loosen your grip. But this doesn’t mean something is wrong. Love isn’t a single, fixed shape—it’s a living thing, shifting as we do. Sometimes holding fast is the truest act of care; other times, letting go is the deeper gift. I’ve learned, often slowly, that both can be love, depending on the season.

I think of my own moments of release—letting a dream evolve, letting a person find their way without my shadow over them. It’s never easy, but there’s a strange peace in trusting that what’s meant to stay will find its way back, reshaped perhaps, but no less real. You don’t have to fix this balance immediately or even figure it out today. Just notice where you’re gripping tight and where you’re already opening your hands. That noticing is enough for now.

If you’re wrestling with this, know there’s no rush to resolve it. Love, like most things worth tending, unfolds at its own pace. I’m here, reflecting on these same tensions, and I’m glad to share this space with you as we both learn what it means to hold and to release.

With peace,
Randy
