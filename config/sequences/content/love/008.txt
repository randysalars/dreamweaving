Subject: Love, Forgiveness, and Letting Go

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot about how love and forgiveness are intertwined, especially when it comes to releasing the past. So often, we hold onto old hurts—not because we want to, but because they’ve become a part of how we see ourselves. They’re heavy, though, aren’t they? And they take up space that could be filled with something softer, something more present. I wonder if you’ve felt this too—a quiet ache for what was, or what could have been, that keeps you from fully stepping into what is.

You’re not strange for feeling this. Many people carry these old stories quietly, sometimes without even realizing how much weight they add. It doesn’t mean something is wrong with you, or that you’ve failed at moving on. It just means you’re human, with a heart that remembers. And that’s a beautiful thing, even when it hurts. What I’ve come to see, in my own slow unraveling, is that forgiveness isn’t about erasing the past—it’s about loosening its grip so you can breathe a little deeper today.

Forgiveness doesn’t have to look like reconciliation, either. It doesn’t mean you need to reach out, or rewrite history, or pretend things didn’t happen. It can be as quiet as deciding, in your own heart, that you’re ready to set this down. You don’t have to fix this immediately, or force yourself to feel something you’re not ready to feel. Maybe it starts with just noticing the weight, and giving yourself permission to imagine what it might be like to let it go, piece by piece.

I’ve found that love—real, grounded love—often waits on the other side of that release. Not necessarily for someone else, but for yourself. For the person you are now, who’s still learning, still growing, still deserving of gentleness. If there’s a part of your past you’ve been carrying, I invite you to sit with it for a moment. Not to solve it, but to ask: What would it feel like to lay this down? There’s no rush. Just the question, and the space to answer it in your own time.

With peace,  
Randy
