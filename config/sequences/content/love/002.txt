Subject: Love as a Daily Choice

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about love lately—not as a fleeting emotion or a rush of warmth, but as something we build with our hands, day by day. It’s not always the grand gesture or the perfect moment. Often, it’s the quiet decision to show up, to listen when you’re tired, to stay when it’s easier to walk away. Love, I’m finding, is less about feeling and more about choosing.

Many people carry this quietly—the weight of wanting love to be effortless, and the disappointment when it isn’t. You’re not strange for feeling this. Relationships, whether with a partner, a friend, or even yourself, ask for commitment that doesn’t always come naturally. It’s the small, deliberate acts—making the coffee, asking the question, forgiving the oversight—that weave something lasting. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if love feels like work. It means you’re engaging with it honestly.

What if we saw love as a practice? Not a destination to reach, but a series of steps we take, even on the days we stumble. You don’t have to fix this immediately or have all the answers. Maybe today, it’s enough to notice where you’re already choosing love—maybe in the way you pause to really see someone, or in the way you give yourself permission to rest. Start there. Let that be your foundation.

I’m not here to tell you how love should look in your life. I’m just reflecting on how it’s showing up in mine—as a series of tiny, intentional moves. If this resonates, I’d love to hear how you’re practicing love these days. Or, simply sit with this thought for a while. There’s no rush.

With peace,  
Randy
