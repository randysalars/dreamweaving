Subject: A Quiet Note on Lasting Peace

Hello,

As we come to the end of this journey through happiness, I want to sit with you for a moment and reflect on something that often slips through our fingers: the difference between a fleeting high and a deeper, quieter joy. I’ve chased both in my life—those bright, electric moments that feel like they’ll solve everything, and the slower, less glamorous peace that seems to grow in the background, almost without notice. I suspect you’ve felt this tug-of-war too. You’re not strange for feeling it, and it doesn’t mean something is wrong if the highs don’t last.

Temporary happiness is often loud. It’s the rush of a win, the thrill of something new, the spike of validation. There’s nothing bad about it—it’s human to crave those peaks. But I’ve noticed they often leave a hollow space behind, a kind of ache for the next thing. Lasting peace, on the other hand, doesn’t shout. It’s in the way the light falls on your morning coffee, or the ease of a conversation where you don’t have to prove anything. It’s not something you chase; it’s something you notice when you pause long enough to let it be there.

Many people carry this quietly—the longing for a joy that doesn’t fade so fast. And if you’re feeling that, I want to say you don’t have to fix it immediately. You don’t have to have it all figured out. Maybe the first step is just seeing the difference for yourself: noticing what feels like a high and what feels like a home. Over time, I’ve learned to lean into the small, steady things, not because they’re better, but because they hold me when the highs inevitably dip.

So as we close this sequence, I invite you to take a breath with me. Look around at what’s already here—the imperfect, the ordinary, the real. That’s often where peace hides, waiting for you to see it. I’m grateful to have shared this space with you, and I hope these reflections have offered something you can carry forward, whether or not our paths cross again.

With peace,  
Randy
