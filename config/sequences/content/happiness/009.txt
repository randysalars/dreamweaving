Subject: Letting a Little Light In

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about how we often keep the windows of our soul shut tight, even on the brightest of days. Not because we don’t want the light, but because we’ve grown used to the dimness—used to protecting ourselves from what might come with opening up. It’s not strange to feel this way. Many of us carry a quiet caution, a habit of guarding against disappointment or hurt, even when it means missing out on warmth.

But there’s something gentle and brave in cracking that window just a bit. Letting light in doesn’t have to mean throwing the shutters wide open all at once. It can be as small as noticing a kind word someone offers, or pausing to feel the sun on your skin for a moment longer than usual. It’s not about forcing happiness or pretending everything is perfect. It’s about allowing yourself to receive what’s already there, waiting for your permission.

You don’t have to fix anything immediately to do this. There’s no rush, no right way to feel more open. If today isn’t the day for it, that’s okay too. Many people carry this quietly—a hesitation to let joy or ease slip in—and it doesn’t mean something is wrong. It just means you’re human, navigating a world that sometimes teaches us to brace more than to bloom.

I wanted to share this thought with you because it’s something I’ve sat with myself: the idea that light doesn’t demand entry. It waits. And when you’re ready, even a sliver of an opening can change the way a whole room feels. If there’s one thing you take from this, let it be the permission to go at your own pace. You’re not behind, and you’re not alone in this.

With peace,  
Randy
