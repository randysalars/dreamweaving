Subject: The Hidden Power of Play

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about play lately—real, unstructured, no-purpose play. The kind we knew as kids when we’d spend hours building forts out of couch cushions or chasing imaginary dragons in the backyard. Somewhere along the way, many of us traded that kind of joy for productivity, for checklists, for “making the most of our time.” And I get it—life asks a lot of us. But I wonder if we’ve quietly lost something vital in the exchange.

Play isn’t just for children. It’s not a luxury or a waste of time. It’s a way to remember who we are beneath the roles we wear—parent, professional, problem-solver. When we let ourselves play, whether it’s doodling in a notebook, dancing to a song in the kitchen, or wandering aimlessly through a park, we’re not escaping life; we’re reconnecting to it. You’re not strange for craving this kind of lightness. Many people carry a quiet ache for it, even if they don’t name it.

What if play didn’t have to earn its place in your day? What if you didn’t need to justify an hour spent on something that brings you joy for no reason at all? This doesn’t mean something is wrong if your days feel too full for play right now. It just means there’s room to notice what lights you up, even in small ways—a silly conversation, a moment of curiosity. You don’t have to fix this immediately or overhaul your life. Just let the idea of play linger with you.

I’d love to hear what play looks like for you these days, if anything comes to mind. Or maybe there’s a memory of play from long ago that still makes you smile. Either way, I’m glad to share this space with you, where we can wonder about these things together.

With lightness,
Randy
