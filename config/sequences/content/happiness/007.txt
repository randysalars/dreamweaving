Subject: Gratitude as an Anchor

Hello,

I’ve been thinking lately about how easy it is to drift—how life can pull us into a current of wanting more, fixing more, becoming more. There’s nothing wrong with ambition or growth, but sometimes that forward lean leaves us unmoored. I’ve felt it myself: the quiet ache of never quite arriving. You’re not strange for feeling this, if you do. Many people carry this quietly, a sense that what’s here, right now, isn’t enough.

But what if it is? What if, just for a moment, we stopped swimming against the current and let ourselves float? I’ve found that gratitude can be an anchor—not the loud, performative kind, but the quiet practice of noticing what’s already here. A warm cup in your hands. The way light falls through a window. A memory of someone who made you laugh. These aren’t grand things, but they’re real. They’re enough to hold onto when everything else feels slippery.

This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you struggle to notice these moments. Some days, the weight of life makes it hard to see anything worth anchoring to. That’s okay. You don’t have to fix this immediately. Maybe start small—pause for one breath and ask yourself, “What’s one thing I’m glad is here?” It might be the smallest thing. It might not even feel like gratitude at first. But over time, I’ve seen how this practice steadies me, like a stone in my pocket I can touch when the world feels too big.

I’m not saying gratitude solves everything. It doesn’t. But it can be a place to stand when you’re not sure where to go next. If this resonates with you, I’d love to hear what anchors you—big or small. Or, just sit with this idea for a while. There’s no rush.

With peace,  
Randy
