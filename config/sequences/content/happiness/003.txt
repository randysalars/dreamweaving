Subject: The Paradox of Choice

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about how often we equate happiness with having more—more options, more paths, more possibilities. It feels like freedom at first, doesn’t it? But then, somewhere along the way, the weight of choosing can creep in. Too many doors open, and suddenly we’re standing still, unsure which one to walk through. I’ve felt this myself, and I’ve seen it in so many others. You’re not strange for feeling overwhelmed by choice.

There’s a quiet truth here: having fewer options can sometimes bring more satisfaction. When the menu is shorter, the decision feels lighter. When the path is narrower, the steps feel clearer. I remember a time when I pared down my commitments to just a handful of things that truly mattered. It wasn’t easy to let go of the “what ifs,” but the relief was almost immediate. I could breathe again. Many people carry this quietly—the tension of too much possibility—and it doesn’t mean something is wrong.

This isn’t about limiting yourself or shrinking your dreams. It’s about noticing where abundance might be disguising itself as burden. What if, just for a moment, you let yourself focus on one thing—one project, one conversation, one small joy—and gave it your full attention? You don’t have to fix this immediately or overhaul your life. Just consider: where might less feel like more to you?

I’m not here to tell you what to choose or how to simplify. I just want to share this thought, in case it resonates. If it does, sit with it. If it doesn’t, that’s okay too. I’m glad to be in this conversation with you, wherever it leads.

With peace,  
Randy
