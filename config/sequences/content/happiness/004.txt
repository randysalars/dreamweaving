Subject: The Quiet Art of Wonder

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about wonder lately— that wide-eyed, childlike ability to be utterly amazed by the world. Do you remember the last time you felt it? Maybe it was a sunset that stopped you in your tracks, or the way a bird’s wings seemed to defy gravity for just a moment. Somewhere along the way, many of us lose that sense of awe, buried under routines and responsibilities. And yet, I believe it’s still there, waiting to be uncovered, if we’re willing to slow down and look.

Wonder isn’t something you have to chase or force. It’s not about grand experiences or faraway places. It’s in the small, often overlooked things— the way light spills through a window, the sound of rain against a roof, or even the steady rhythm of your own breath. Many people carry this longing for amazement quietly, feeling almost silly for wanting to see the world with fresh eyes again. You’re not strange for feeling this. It’s not a childish thing to seek; it’s a deeply human one.

What if you didn’t have to “do” anything to reclaim it? What if wonder is less about finding new things and more about seeing the familiar with new curiosity? You don’t have to fix this immediately or turn your life upside down to feel it. Maybe it starts with a single moment— pausing to notice the texture of a leaf, or the way a stranger’s smile shifts the air. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if wonder feels far away right now. It just means there’s room to invite it back, at your own pace.

I’m curious— what’s one thing that used to amaze you, or still does when you let yourself notice? There’s no rush to answer, no need to make it profound. Just let the question linger if it feels right. I’m here, reflecting on this alongside you, remembering how even the smallest spark of wonder can light up a whole day.

With peace,  
Randy
