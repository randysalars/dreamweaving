Subject: The Luxury of Fragility

Hello,

I’ve been thinking lately about how much of modern life is built to shield us from fragility. We’ve engineered convenience into every corner—fast delivery, instant answers, climate control at the touch of a button. It’s a kind of armor, isn’t it? A way to avoid the raw edges of being human. And yet, I wonder if in protecting ourselves from discomfort, we’ve also distanced ourselves from something vital. Something that feels, oddly, like a luxury—the chance to be breakable, to struggle, to meet the difficult head-on.

There’s a quiet satisfaction in doing things the hard way sometimes. Chopping wood for a fire instead of flipping a switch. Writing a letter by hand instead of typing a quick text. These aren’t just tasks; they’re encounters with our own limits, our own patience. They remind us that we’re not machines, that we can tire, that we can falter—and that’s not a failing. You’re not strange for craving this kind of challenge, even if the world around you seems obsessed with ease. Many people carry this quietly, a longing for the weight of effort, for the joy that comes only after the ache.

This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you lean on modern conveniences—far from it. We all need support, and there’s no shame in accepting what’s been built to help us. But there’s also room to step outside that bubble when you feel called to. To plant a garden and watch half of it fail to drought or pests. To walk a long path instead of driving. To let yourself feel fragile in a world that often demands toughness. You don’t have to fix this immediately or turn your life upside down—just notice where you might invite a little difficulty in, if only for the sake of feeling alive.

I’ve found that the hard things often carry the deepest rewards. Not because they make us better or stronger in some measurable way, but because they let us touch the edges of who we are. If you’re drawn to this, give yourself permission to explore it at your own pace. If you’re not, that’s just as true. There’s no right way to be human, only the way that feels most honest to you.

With peace,
Randy
