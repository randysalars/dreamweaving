Subject: The Trap of the Gear List

Hello,

I’ve noticed something over the years of exploring wild places and guiding others through their own uncertainties: we often fixate on gear. The right backpack, the best knife, the lightest tent—it’s easy to believe that survival, or even thriving, comes down to a perfect checklist of things. I’ve fallen into this trap myself, spending hours researching specs, convinced that one more item would make me “ready.” But here’s the quiet truth: gear is just a tool, not the answer. You’re not strange for feeling that pull toward the tangible, the buyable—it’s human to want something solid to hold onto when the world feels unsteady.

The real weight of survival isn’t in your pack; it’s in your mind. Skills—knowing how to read the land, how to stay calm when plans unravel, how to make do with what’s at hand—don’t take up space or cost a dime once you’ve learned them. Many people carry this quietly, the realization that no gadget can replace the steady confidence of experience. I’ve been in situations where my gear failed, and it was the unglamorous, hard-won knowledge of how to adapt that kept me grounded. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you’re drawn to gear lists or shiny tools; it just means there’s a deeper layer worth exploring.

I’m not here to tell you to ditch your equipment or shame you for wanting it. Gear has its place—good tools can make hard things easier. But I’ve learned, sometimes the slow way, that the most reliable thing you carry is your own capacity to think, to observe, to endure. You don’t have to fix this immediately or overhaul your approach overnight. If you’re feeling the itch to buy one more thing for “just in case,” pause and ask: What skill could I lean into instead? What do I already know that I’m not trusting?

Let this sit with you. There’s no rush to figure it out, no perfect kit to complete. I’m just sharing what I’ve seen, hoping it might lighten the load—physically and otherwise.

With peace,  
Randy
