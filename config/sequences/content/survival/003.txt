Subject: Survival Isn't a Solo Journey

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the stories we tell ourselves around survival. There’s this pervasive myth of the “lone wolf”—the idea that true strength means standing alone, figuring it out without help, carving a path through sheer grit. I carried that image for years, believing that asking for support was a sign of weakness. But the more I’ve lived, the more I’ve seen how survival isn’t a solo act. It’s a community effort, even when we don’t see the hands holding us up.

Think about the last time you felt truly lost or overwhelmed. Maybe you didn’t call anyone. Maybe you didn’t even speak the struggle out loud. But somewhere, in the quiet, there was a memory of someone who’d been through it before, a conversation that gave you a scrap of courage, or even a stranger’s small kindness that reminded you you’re not invisible. Many people carry this quietly—the need for connection, the way we lean on each other without always naming it. You’re not strange for feeling this pull toward others, even if you’ve been taught to hide it.

Self-reliance isn’t about isolation; it’s about knowing who and what you can trust when the ground shakes. Community—whether it’s one person, a family, or a network of quiet allies—becomes the foundation. It’s not about losing your independence but about weaving a net so strong that you can take risks, fail, and still stand up again. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you’ve felt alone lately. It just means the door to connection is always there, waiting for you to step through when you’re ready.

I’ve learned this slowly, often the hard way, through moments of reaching out when I thought I couldn’t. And I’ve seen it in others, too—how we survive not by shutting out the world, but by letting it in, piece by piece. You don’t have to fix this immediately or force yourself into spaces that don’t feel right. Just know that survival isn’t meant to be a weight you carry alone. It’s shared, even in the smallest ways.

With peace,
Randy
