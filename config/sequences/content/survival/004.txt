Subject: The Intelligence of Your Hands

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about hands lately—yours, mine, anyone’s. In a world that often feels like it’s all screens and algorithms, there’s a quiet power in what our hands can do. Picking up a tool, mending a broken thing, or even just feeling the weight of something real—it’s a kind of intelligence that doesn’t get enough credit. I’ve found that when I fix something with my hands, I’m not just repairing an object; I’m reclaiming a small piece of freedom. Maybe you’ve felt this too, or maybe it’s been a while since you’ve thought about it.

There’s nothing strange about craving that tactile connection. Many people carry this quietly—a pull toward making or mending, even if it’s just tightening a loose screw or patching a tear. It’s not about being a craftsman or having some grand skill. It’s about remembering that you’re not helpless, that you can interact with the world on your terms. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you’ve been too busy or too caught up in the digital grind to notice. It’s just an invitation to come back to your hands when you’re ready.

I remember a time when I felt utterly stuck, like everything in my life was out of my control. I picked up a hammer one day to fix a wobbly chair, and though it wasn’t a perfect job, something shifted. My hands reminded me I could act, I could solve, I could shape something real. It wasn’t about the chair—it was about proving to myself that not everything has to be outsourced or automated. If you’ve ever felt that small triumph, you know what I mean. If you haven’t, there’s no rush to find it; it’s waiting for you whenever you’re ready to pick up a tool or touch something broken.

So today, or whenever it feels right, I encourage you to notice your hands. Maybe there’s something small to fix—a drawer that sticks, a button that’s loose—or maybe it’s just holding a cup of coffee and feeling its warmth. You don’t have to fix this immediately, or at all. But if you do, let it be a reminder: your hands carry a wisdom that no app or algorithm can replicate. They’re a direct line to your own agency, and that’s a kind of survival all its own.

With peace,
Randy
