Subject: Beyond Logic: The Language of the Soul

Hello,

There’s a place within us that logic can’t quite touch—a quiet, vast space where our deepest yearnings and unspoken truths reside. You’ve likely felt it at times, maybe in a moment of stillness or when a memory catches you off guard. It’s not something you can pin down with a spreadsheet or a to-do list, and that’s okay. You’re not strange for feeling this pull toward something beyond reason.

Poetry, I’ve found, is one of the few bridges to that place. It’s not about solving or explaining but about sitting with what is—whether it’s beauty, ache, or mystery. A single line can unravel a feeling you didn’t even know you were carrying. Many people carry this quietly, this need to connect with something larger than the daily grind, and poetry offers a language for it. It’s not about having the right words; it’s about letting the words find you.

I remember a time when I felt utterly lost, trying to make sense of a grief that wouldn’t fit into any framework I knew. I stumbled across a poem—nothing grand, just a few lines about a bird in winter—and it cracked something open in me. Not an answer, but a recognition. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you feel that same longing for meaning beyond logic. It’s a sign you’re alive to the mystery of being human.

So, if you’re drawn to poetry, or even if you’re unsure about it, give yourself permission to linger with a few lines. You don’t have to fix this need for depth immediately, or even understand it. Just let it be a quiet companion for a while. If you’ve got a favorite poem or a line that’s stayed with you, I’d love to hear it—I’m always moved by what resonates with others.

With peace,  
Randy
