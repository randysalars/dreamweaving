Subject: The Space Between Words

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about silence lately—how it lives in poetry, how it shapes what we say by framing what we don’t. A poem isn’t just the words on the page; it’s the pauses, the line breaks, the vast unsaid that lingers. I wonder if you’ve ever noticed this too, how what isn’t spoken can carry as much weight as what is. You’re not strange for feeling the pull of those quiet spaces, for sensing there’s something alive in them.

Many people carry this quietly—this awareness that silence isn’t empty, but full. In our lives, just like in a poem, we often focus on the words: the things we do, the things we say, the noise of getting through a day. But there’s a kind of truth in what we leave out, in the moments we choose not to fill. Maybe it’s a thought you didn’t share, a feeling you held back, or a memory you let sit undisturbed. This doesn’t mean something is wrong. It’s just the shape of being human, the way we make room for what matters most, even if we can’t name it.

I’ve found, in writing and in living, that silence can be a kind of listening. It’s where we hear ourselves, or someone else, in a way words sometimes obscure. If you’re drawn to poetry, or even just to the idea of it, you might already know this—how a single line can stop you, not because of what it says, but because of what it leaves for you to feel. You don’t have to fix this or figure it out immediately. There’s no rush to fill the quiet with meaning or action. Sometimes, just noticing it is enough.

I hope you’ll take a moment today to sit with a silence of your own, whether in a poem or in the rhythm of your day. Let it be there, without needing to change it. I’m curious what you might hear.

With peace,  
Randy
