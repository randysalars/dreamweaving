Subject: When Your Inner Critic Silences Your Creative Child

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about the voices we carry inside us—particularly the inner critic, that sharp-edged part of us that often drowns out the softer, more curious voice of our creative child. You know the one I mean: the critic who says your ideas are foolish, your words aren’t good enough, or your dreams are too big to even whisper aloud. And then there’s that other part, the childlike wonder that once saw the world as a playground of possibility, who scribbled poems in notebooks or imagined stories in the shapes of clouds. Many people carry this quiet tension between the two, and you’re not strange for feeling it.

Here’s what I’ve noticed: the inner critic often speaks from a place of protection, not malice. It’s trying to shield you from failure, embarrassment, or pain. But in doing so, it can bury the very part of you that longs to create, to play, to express without judgment. I’ve felt this myself—times when I’ve sat down to write or dream, only to hear that voice telling me it’s a waste of time. And yet, when I’ve paused to listen to that smaller, brighter voice—the one that doesn’t care about perfection—I’ve found something true. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if the critic feels louder right now. It’s just a sign that part of you is asking for a different kind of attention.

What might happen if you gave that creative child a moment to speak? Not to produce something grand or polished, but just to be heard. Maybe it’s writing a single line of poetry that no one else will see. Maybe it’s remembering a time when you created without fear. You don’t have to fix this dynamic immediately or force the critic to be silent—it’s enough to notice it, to offer a little space for wonder to breathe. I believe that reclaiming this part of yourself isn’t about silencing one voice, but about letting both exist, with the child’s curiosity guiding the way more often.

I’m rooting for you as you navigate this inner landscape. If it feels right, take a small step toward listening to that quieter, more playful voice. There’s no rush, no right or wrong way to do this—just an invitation to remember what it felt like to create for the joy of it.

With peace,
