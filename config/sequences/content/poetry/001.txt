Subject: The Weight of a Single Word

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about words lately—how a single one can shift the air in a room, or in your chest. In poetry, a word isn’t just a sound or a shape on the page; it’s a tiny vessel carrying centuries of meaning, memory, and ache. Choose “stone” over “rock,” and suddenly there’s a heaviness, a history, a permanence. Precision in language isn’t about being correct—it’s about being true to the feeling you’re trying to name. Have you ever paused over a word, sensing its weight before letting it fall?

I remember struggling with this early on, wrestling with lines that felt close but not quite right. I’d write “sad” when I meant “hollow,” or “angry” when I meant “unseen.” It wasn’t just semantics; it was a failure to honor what was real inside me. Many people carry this quietly—the frustration of not finding the exact word to match the emotion. You’re not strange for feeling this. It’s not a flaw; it’s a sign you’re reaching for something deeper.

Poetry teaches us that language is a craft of listening as much as speaking. You don’t have to rush to pin down the perfect phrase. Sometimes, sitting with the almost-right word reveals what you truly meant to say. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if the words don’t come easily. It’s a slow unfolding, a conversation between you and the page.

If you’ve ever felt the power of a single word—whether in a poem, a conversation, or a fleeting thought—I’d love to hear about it. Or perhaps there’s a word you’ve been circling, one that feels heavier than you expected. There’s no need to resolve it now. Just notice it. Let it sit with you.

With peace,
