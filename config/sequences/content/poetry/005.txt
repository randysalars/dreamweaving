Subject: Creative Block as a Sacred Pause

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about the quiet that comes with a creative block. It’s not the kind of silence we often seek, is it? It can feel heavy, like a room with no windows, or like you’ve misplaced something vital—your voice, your spark. I’ve been there, staring at a blank page or an empty canvas, wondering if the well has run dry for good. And I want to say, you’re not strange for feeling this. Many people carry this quietly, doubting if they’ll ever create again.

But what if this stuck-ness isn’t a failure? What if it’s a sacred pause, a kind of incubation that your soul needs before the next thing can emerge? I’ve noticed that nature doesn’t rush. Seeds don’t apologize for taking time beneath the soil, and rivers don’t hurry to carve their paths. Maybe your block is less about being broken and more about gathering—gathering strength, clarity, or even just rest. This doesn’t mean something is wrong. It might mean something is preparing to be right.

I’m not here to tell you how to break through. There’s no formula I can hand you, and honestly, I don’t think you need one. What I do want to offer is permission to sit with this pause, to let it be what it is without judgment. You don’t have to fix this immediately. Sometimes, the most creative act is to wait—to listen to what the silence might be whispering if you give it space.

If you feel like sharing, I’d love to hear how this block feels for you. Or, if you’d rather just sit with it, that’s okay too. I’m here, either way, believing in the quiet work happening beneath the surface.

With peace,  
Randy
