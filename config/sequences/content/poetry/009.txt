Subject: Discovering the Voice That’s Yours Alone

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the journey to finding our own voice—that unique way of expressing who we are, whether through words, art, or simply how we show up in the world. It’s not a straight path, is it? There are detours, moments of mimicry where we borrow from others to learn, and long stretches of silence where we wonder if we’ll ever sound like ourselves. You’re not strange for feeling this uncertainty. Many people carry this quietly, questioning if their voice even matters.

But here’s something I’ve noticed: the voice that’s truly yours doesn’t arrive with fanfare. It often emerges in the small, unguarded moments—when you’re scribbling a thought no one will read, or speaking a truth you didn’t plan to share. It’s less about perfection and more about honesty. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you haven’t found it yet. It just means you’re still listening, still gathering the pieces of yourself that want to be heard.

I remember a time when I felt my words were just echoes of others—teachers, poets, people I admired. I’d write, then erase, convinced I had nothing new to say. What shifted for me was letting go of the need to be original and instead focusing on being real. What did I feel? What did I see that no one else could see in quite the same way? You don’t have to fix this search for your voice immediately. It’s okay to let it unfold slowly, to trust that every word, even the clumsy ones, is a step closer to you.

So, if you’re wrestling with this, give yourself room. Speak, write, or create in the smallest way today, even if it’s just for yourself. Notice what feels true, not what feels impressive. I’m here, walking this path too, and I believe that voice—your voice—is already there, waiting for the right moment to rise.

With peace,  
Randy
