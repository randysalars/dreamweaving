Subject: The Beauty of the Unfinished

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about the rough drafts of our lives—the half-written poems, the sketches on napkins, the ideas that live in the back of our minds but haven’t yet found their full shape. There’s something sacred in these unfinished things, isn’t there? They hold a kind of raw honesty, a glimpse of who we were when we started, full of hope or curiosity or even uncertainty. I want to sit with that idea today, and I invite you to join me if it feels right.

So often, we’re taught to focus on the finished product—polished, complete, ready to be shown. But I’ve come to see that the unfinished holds its own kind of beauty. It’s the space where we’re still figuring things out, still listening to what wants to emerge. Many people carry this quietly, a sense of not being “done” with something, or even with themselves. And I want to say: this doesn’t mean something is wrong. It means you’re in process, which is exactly where life happens.

I’ve got notebooks full of lines that don’t quite work, ideas for poems that never made it past the first stanza. For a long time, I thought they were failures. But now, I see them as evidence of trying, of showing up, of letting something messy and real take up space. You’re not strange for feeling attached to your own rough drafts—whether they’re literal or the unfinished parts of your story. They’re proof of your courage to begin, even when the ending isn’t clear.

If there’s something unfinished in your life right now, you don’t have to fix it immediately. Let it be what it is for a while. Look at it with kind eyes, the way you might look at a child’s first drawing—not for perfection, but for the heart behind it. There’s value in the attempt, in the act of creating, even if it never becomes what you imagined.

With peace,  
Randy
