Subject: Money as a Mirror

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how money isn’t just a tool or a number—it’s a mirror. The way we spend, save, or even avoid thinking about it often reflects deeper beliefs we hold about our own worth, our safety, and what we think we deserve. If you’ve ever felt a pang of guilt over a purchase, or hesitated to invest in something for yourself, you’re not strange for feeling this. Many people carry these quiet tensions, often without naming them.

Take a moment to consider your own patterns. Do you spend freely on others but tighten up when it comes to yourself? Or maybe you save relentlessly, as if security is always just one more dollar away. These habits aren’t random—they’re often tied to stories we’ve inherited or experiences that shaped us. This doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. It’s just a reflection of how you’ve learned to navigate the world, and noticing it can be a powerful first step.

I’m not here to tell you what your spending “should” look like. Instead, I invite you to study yourself with curiosity, not judgment. Look at the last few things you spent money on—what do they say about what you value or fear? When do you feel most at ease with money, and when does it feel like a weight? You don’t have to fix this immediately. Simply observing can reveal so much about how you see yourself and your place in the world.

If you’d like to explore this further, I’m here to walk alongside you. The Dreamweaving process often uncovers these hidden mirrors, not just with money, but with time, energy, and attention. For now, though, just let this sit with you. There’s no rush to figure it all out.

With peace,
