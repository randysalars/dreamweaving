Subject: The True Wealth of Time

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot about time lately—not in the hurried, ticking-clock way, but in the quiet, expansive way it shapes us. We often frame wealth as something we can count in dollars or achievements, but time is the one resource we can’t renew, no matter how much we earn. It’s the silent currency we trade every day, often without noticing. You’re not strange for feeling that tug—wondering if the hours you’re giving are worth what you’re getting in return.

Many people carry this quietly: the ache of trading time for income, for security, for a future they hope will feel freer. It’s not wrong to make that trade—life often demands it—but it’s worth pausing to ask what you’re truly buying with your hours. Is it more space to breathe, to create, to be with those you love? Or is it just more of the same cycle, spinning faster? This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you’re caught in that loop; it just means you’re human, navigating a world that often measures worth by output instead of presence.

What if wealth wasn’t just about accumulating, but about reclaiming time as your own? I’ve found, in my own slow unraveling, that the richest moments aren’t the ones filled with more money or stuff—they’re the ones where I have the freedom to simply be. To sit with a thought, to watch the light change, to listen to someone without rushing. You don’t have to fix this immediately or upend your life to chase that kind of wealth. Start small, if you want—notice where your time feels stolen, and where it feels like a gift. That noticing is a kind of wealth, too.

I’m not here to tell you what to do with your hours, only to share that I’ve wrestled with this same question. If it resonates, let it sit with you. If it doesn’t, that’s okay too. I’m just glad to share this space for a moment.

With peace,  
Randy
