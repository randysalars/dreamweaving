Subject: Wealth as a Gift of Service

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about wealth—not just as money in the bank, but as a kind of energy that flows when we contribute something meaningful. I’ve noticed in my own life that the moments I feel wealthiest aren’t tied to a paycheck or a balance sheet. They’re tied to the times I’ve been able to give something of value to someone else, whether it’s a kind word, a piece of hard-earned wisdom, or a creation that helps someone see the world a little differently. Wealth, in this sense, feels like a byproduct of service.

Many people carry this quietly—the desire to build something that matters, to offer a piece of themselves to the world, and yet they wonder if it’s enough. You’re not strange for feeling this pull, or for questioning whether your contribution could ever translate into the kind of wealth that sustains you. I’ve wrestled with that myself. What I’ve come to see is that wealth doesn’t start with a transaction; it starts with an intention to serve, to solve a real problem, to lift someone up. When we focus there, the resources often follow in ways we couldn’t predict.

This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you’re not seeing that flow yet. Building wealth through contribution takes time, and it’s not a straight line. Some seasons are for planting seeds—listening, learning, creating without immediate reward. Other seasons are for harvest. You don’t have to fix this immediately or force an outcome. Just keep asking yourself: What can I give that feels true to me? How can I help in a way that only I can? Those questions have guided me more than any business plan ever could.

I’d love to hear how this lands with you, or what you’ve noticed about wealth and service in your own life. There’s no rush to reply—just know I’m here, reading and reflecting alongside you as we explore this together.

With peace,  
Randy
