Subject: The Trap of 'Enough'

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot about the word 'enough' lately. It’s a quiet word, isn’t it? But it carries a heavy weight when we tie it to wealth, to worth, to the shape of our lives. So often, we let 'enough' be defined by what we see around us—by the neighbor’s new car, the colleague’s promotion, or the endless scroll of curated lives on social media. And in that comparison, 'enough' becomes a moving target, always just out of reach. I’ve fallen into that trap myself, and I suspect you might have too. You’re not strange for feeling this pull.

Here’s what I’ve noticed, though: when we chase someone else’s version of 'enough,' we lose sight of our own. We stop asking what truly fills us, what makes a day feel rich, even if it’s just a quiet moment with a cup of tea or a walk where the world feels briefly still. I’m not saying comparison is wrong—it’s human. Many people carry this quietly, this sense of measuring up. But what if 'enough' could be something you define for yourself, something that doesn’t shift with every external marker? What if it’s already closer than you think?

This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you’re still searching for that definition. I’ve spent years circling this question, and I still don’t have it all figured out. But I’ve found a certain peace in deciding that 'enough' doesn’t have to be loud or grand. It can be as simple as knowing I’ve honored my own values today, or that I’ve made space for what matters to me, even if it looks small to someone else. You don’t have to fix this immediately—there’s no rush to pin down your 'enough.' Just let the question sit with you. Let it breathe.

I’d love to hear what 'enough' feels like for you, if you’re inclined to share. Or simply take a moment today to notice one thing that feels like plenty, just as it is. That’s a start, and it’s more than enough for now.

With peace,  
Randy
