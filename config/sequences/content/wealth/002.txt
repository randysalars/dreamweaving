Subject: Scarcity or Abundance: A Quiet Shift in Perspective

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot about how we see the world through the lens of scarcity or abundance—not just in terms of money, but in time, energy, and even love. It’s a quiet tension many of us carry, often without naming it. You might notice it in the way your chest tightens when you think there’s not enough to go around, or in the subtle relief when you realize there’s more than you feared. You’re not strange for feeling this. It’s human to waver between these two poles.

Scarcity tells us to grip tighter, to hoard what we have, to see every opportunity as a potential loss if we don’t act fast. Abundance, though, whispers something different—it invites us to loosen our hold, to trust that there’s enough, or at least that we can create more together. I’ve lived in both mindsets, and I’ve noticed how scarcity shrinks my world into sharp edges, while abundance feels like stepping into a wider field, where there’s room to breathe. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you feel scarce right now. It’s just a signal, a place to pause and notice.

What if the shift isn’t about having more, but about seeing differently? I’ve found that even in moments of real lack, there’s often a small abundance hiding—maybe in a kind word, a shared meal, or the simple fact that you’re still here, trying. Many people carry this quietly, the fear of not enough, but I’ve seen how even a tiny reframe can change the air in a room. You don’t have to fix this immediately or force yourself into some grand state of abundance. Just notice where you are today. That’s enough for now.

I’ll share more about this in the coming days—how I’ve learned to lean into abundance, even when it feels counterintuitive. For now, I’m curious about where you find yourself. There’s no rush to answer, or even to know. I’m just glad to be in this conversation with you.

With peace,  
Randy
