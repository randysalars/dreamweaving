Subject: Letting Meaning Arrive in Its Own Time

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about how often we push for answers—how we sit with a question or a longing and feel the need to resolve it quickly, as if clarity is a race. But I’ve noticed, in my own life and in conversations with others, that meaning often arrives sideways. It doesn’t come when we’re staring straight at it, demanding it to show up. It slips in through the corner of our vision, in a quiet moment, when we’re not even looking. I wanted to share this with you today, in case you’re holding something that feels unanswered.

You’re not strange for feeling restless about the things you don’t yet understand—whether it’s the direction of your work, the shape of a dream, or even the ‘why’ behind what you’re building. Many people carry this quietly, this sense of waiting for something to click. I’ve sat with it myself, wondering if I’m missing a piece of the puzzle. But I’ve learned that forcing the pieces together rarely works. Instead, I’ve started to trust that meaning needs space to breathe, to wander a bit before it settles in.

This doesn’t mean something is wrong if the answers aren’t here yet. You don’t have to fix this immediately or figure it all out by some imagined deadline. What if, just for now, you let yourself live alongside the question? What if you allowed yourself to notice the small, sideways moments— a passing thought while washing dishes, a line in a book that catches you off guard, a conversation that lingers? These are often the ways meaning begins to weave itself into our days, without fanfare or force.

I’m sharing this because I believe in moving slowly, in honoring the human pace of understanding. Dreamweaving, at its heart, is about creating with this kind of patience—trusting that what you’re building, dreaming, or seeking will reveal itself when the time is right. If you’re feeling the weight of unanswered questions, I hope you can give yourself permission to let them be for a while. They’re not going anywhere, and neither are you.

With peace,  
Randy
