Subject: When the World Feels Too Loud

Hello,

Lately, I’ve noticed how the world seems to hum at a higher pitch. The news, the notifications, the endless scroll of voices—both digital and real—can feel like a constant clamor pressing against the edges of our quiet. If you’ve been feeling this too, you’re not strange for it. Many people carry this sense of overload quietly, unsure if it’s okay to admit that sometimes it’s just too much.

This doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. It’s not a flaw to notice the noise or to crave a softer space. Our senses are wired to take in so much, but they weren’t built for the relentless volume of modern life. I’ve found myself stepping away more often—closing the laptop, leaving the phone in another room, letting the silence settle like dust after a storm. You don’t have to fix this feeling immediately, or even at all. Sometimes, simply naming it can be enough to loosen its grip.

What if, for a moment, you gave yourself permission to turn down the volume? Not forever, not as a rejection of the world, but as a small act of tending to yourself. Maybe it’s a walk without earbuds, or a few minutes with a window open, listening to nothing but the air. I’ve been reminded lately that slowness isn’t laziness—it’s a way of listening deeper. In the work of Dreamweaving, this is where I often find the threads of what matters most: in the quiet, where the noise can’t reach.

If this resonates, I’m here as you explore what slowness might mean for you. There’s no rush to figure it out, no checklist to complete. I’m just glad to share this space with you, where the world’s loudness doesn’t have to be the only story.

With peace,  
Randy
