Subject: For the Ones Tired in a Way Rest Doesn’t Touch

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about a kind of tiredness that doesn’t ease with a good night’s sleep or a weekend away. It’s the kind that sits in your bones, in the quiet moments when you’re alone with your thoughts. Maybe you’ve felt it too—a weariness that isn’t just physical, but something deeper, tied to the weight of trying, of carrying, of always reaching for the next thing. You’re not strange for feeling this. Many people carry this quietly, often without even naming it.

This doesn’t mean something is wrong. It might just mean you’ve been running on a kind of inner fuel that’s hard to replenish when the world keeps asking for more. I’ve been there myself—pushing forward because I thought that’s what strength looked like, only to realize I was moving further from what I actually needed. I’m not here to tell you what that need is, only to say it’s okay to pause long enough to listen for it.

You don’t have to fix this immediately. There’s no rush to figure it all out or to become someone who “has it together.” What if, just for a moment, you let yourself be exactly as you are—tired, uncertain, human? What if stopping wasn’t giving up, but a way of coming home to yourself? I’ve found that sometimes the bravest thing we can do is to set down the striving, even if just for a breath.

I’ll be writing to you again soon, sharing more about this idea of weaving dreams—not as a way to escape, but as a way to remember what matters. For now, I just wanted to reach out and say I see you in this quiet kind of tired. You’re not alone in it.

With peace,
Randy
