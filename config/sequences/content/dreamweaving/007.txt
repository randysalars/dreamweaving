Subject: Missing Who You Used to Be

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about the quiet ache that comes when we miss an older version of ourselves. Maybe it’s the person who laughed a little louder, who took risks without overthinking, or who felt more at home in their own skin. It’s a strange kind of grief, isn’t it? Not for someone else, but for a piece of you that seems to have slipped away over time. You’re not strange for feeling this—many people carry this quietly, often without naming it.

This doesn’t mean something is wrong with who you are now. Growth and change are inevitable, and sometimes they carve away bits of us to make room for something new. But it’s okay to mourn the parts that didn’t make the journey with you. Maybe you miss the dreamer who believed anything was possible, or the one who didn’t yet know the weight of certain responsibilities. There’s a tenderness in looking back, in honoring who you were, even if you can’t fully return to that place.

I wonder if there’s a way to hold space for both—the you of now and the you of then. Not to fix anything or force a reunion, but just to let them sit side by side for a moment. You don’t have to rush to resolve this feeling or push it aside. If you’re carrying this quiet grief, give yourself permission to name it, to let it breathe. Sometimes, that’s enough to soften the edges.

In Dreamweaving, we often explore these layers of identity—how they shift, how they linger, how they shape us even when they’re no longer at the forefront. If you ever want to dive deeper into this with gentle guidance, I’m here. But for now, just know you’re not alone in missing pieces of yourself. It’s part of being human.

With peace,
Randy
