Subject: Why Stillness Can Feel Like a Threat at First

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about stillness lately—how it can be both a refuge and a confrontation. When we slow down, when we let the noise of the world fade for even a moment, we often come face-to-face with parts of ourselves we’ve been outrunning. It’s not strange to feel uneasy in those quiet spaces. Many people carry this quietly: the sense that stillness is somehow dangerous, that if we stop moving, something might catch up with us—whether it’s a thought, a memory, or a question we’re not ready to answer.

But here’s something I’ve noticed over the years of weaving dreams and sitting with silence: that discomfort is often just the first layer. Beneath it, there’s a kind of rest that doesn’t demand anything of you. Stillness isn’t about fixing or figuring out; it’s about allowing. You don’t have to know what to do with the thoughts that arise. You don’t have to push them away or solve them. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if they feel heavy at first. It just means you’re human, and humans are complex, layered beings who need time to settle.

I remember a time when I couldn’t sit still for more than a few minutes without feeling like I was failing at something—productivity, progress, purpose. But over time, I began to see stillness as less of a threat and more of an invitation. It’s not about emptying your mind or achieving some perfect state of calm. It’s about giving yourself permission to be, just as you are, even if that feels messy or uncertain. You don’t have to fix this immediately. You don’t have to fix it at all.

If stillness feels hard right now, that’s okay. Start where you are—a single breath, a moment of closing your eyes, a pause before the next task. There’s no rush. In the spirit of Slow Business, I believe the deepest connections, the truest insights, come when we let things unfold at their own pace. I’m here to walk alongside you in this, not to push or hurry, but to remind you that there’s space for you to explore this in your own way.

With peace,
Randy
