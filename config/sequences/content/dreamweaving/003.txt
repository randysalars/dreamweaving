Subject: When Faith Feels Thin, Not Gone

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about the quiet seasons—those stretches where faith, or whatever anchors you, feels more like a whisper than a shout. It’s not that it’s gone, but it’s thin, like a thread you’re not sure will hold if you pull too hard. You’re not strange for feeling this. Many people carry this quietly, wondering if they’re the only ones who’ve ever doubted something they once held so close.

These seasons aren’t a sign of failure or a signal that something is wrong. They’re just part of being human, of living in a world that doesn’t always make sense. I’ve walked through my own dry spells, where the practices and beliefs that once felt like home seemed distant, almost foreign. What I’ve noticed, though, is that even in the thinnest moments, there’s often a small pulse—a memory, a question, a tiny ache for meaning—that keeps showing up. It’s not loud, but it’s there, waiting for you to notice it again.

You don’t have to fix this immediately. There’s no rush to rebuild or force certainty. Sometimes, just sitting with the thinness, letting it be what it is, can teach you something you wouldn’t have seen otherwise. Maybe it’s showing you what you still long for, or maybe it’s asking you to let go of an old way of holding on. Whatever it is, there’s room for you to move through this at your own pace, in your own way.

If you’ve felt this too, I’d love to hear about it—if you’re up for sharing. And if not, that’s okay too. I’m just here, writing these words, hoping they meet you wherever you are. Dreamweaving isn’t about having all the answers; it’s about making space for the questions, the doubts, and the slow, quiet work of coming back to what matters to you.

With peace,  
Randy
