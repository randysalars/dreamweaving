Subject: A Letter for the Unclear Threshold

Hello,

There’s a particular kind of quiet that comes when you’re standing between chapters of your life. It’s not the silence of rest or resolution, but the hush of uncertainty—a space where the old has faded, and the new hasn’t yet taken shape. I’ve lingered in these thresholds myself, and I’ve noticed how they can feel both heavy and empty at the same time. You’re not strange for feeling this. Many people carry this quietly, unsure if they’re supposed to push forward or simply wait.

These in-between places often bring a subtle discomfort, like wearing a coat that no longer fits but hasn’t yet been replaced. There’s a temptation to rush through, to force clarity or make a decision just to escape the ambiguity. But I’ve learned that thresholds have their own rhythm. They’re not meant to be crossed in a hurry. This doesn’t mean something is wrong. It’s okay to stand here for a while, to let the questions breathe without demanding answers.

If you’re in this space right now, I want to offer you permission to be still with it. You don’t have to fix this immediately. Sometimes, the most honest thing we can do is acknowledge where we are—neither fully here nor there—and let that be enough for now. I’ve found that clarity often arrives not when I chase it, but when I stop running and listen to the quiet. What might this threshold be whispering to you, if you gave it a moment?

I’m here with you in spirit, not to guide or push, but to sit in the uncertainty alongside you. If there’s something stirring in your heart about this in-between, or if you’re simply feeling the weight of it, know that you’re seen. Dreamweaving, at its core, is about honoring these tender, unclear spaces as much as the bold steps forward.

With peace,  
Randy
