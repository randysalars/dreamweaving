Subject: The Ethics Behind the Invisible

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot about what we don’t see when we interact with AI—those vast, invisible systems that power the tools we’re starting to rely on. It’s easy to marvel at the outputs, the speed, the seeming magic of it all. But beneath the surface, there’s a human story. Real people have labeled data, trained models, and often worked in grueling conditions to make these systems function. Many carry this quietly, unaware of the labor or the ethical weight behind the convenience. You’re not strange for feeling a tug of unease when you think about it.

The datasets that fuel AI often come from places we don’t fully understand—scraped from the internet, pulled from public spaces, or gathered in ways that might not align with how we’d want our own words or images used. There’s a question here that I keep turning over: Are we okay with progress if it means someone, somewhere, is unseen or undervalued? I don’t have an answer, and I’m not here to tell you what to think. This doesn’t mean something is wrong with you if you use these tools, or if you’re unsure where you stand. It’s a complex web, and we’re all navigating it together.

What I do know is that awareness matters. Slowing down to ask where something comes from—whether it’s a piece of technology or the food on our table—grounds us in our humanity. It’s not about guilt or perfection; it’s about intent. You don’t have to fix this immediately or stop using AI altogether. But maybe there’s space to wonder: How can I engage with these tools in a way that feels aligned with my values? I’m asking myself the same thing, and I’m okay with not having it all figured out yet.

I hope this gives you a moment to pause, to reflect on the invisible threads that connect us through technology. If it stirs something in you, sit with it. There’s no rush to resolve it.

With peace,  
Randy
