Subject: The Quiet Loss of the Ugly First Draft

Hello,

I’ve been thinking lately about the messy, imperfect beauty of a first draft—the kind that’s full of crossed-out lines, half-formed thoughts, and awkward phrasing that makes you cringe when you read it back. There’s something deeply human in that struggle, isn’t there? The act of wrestling with your own mind to get something onto the page, even if it’s far from perfect. It’s a quiet battle, but one that often feels like the truest part of creating.

With AI, that friction is smoothed away. A prompt, a click, and there it is: a polished piece of text, ready to go. It’s efficient, no question. But I wonder what we lose when we skip the ugly first draft—when we bypass the discomfort of not knowing, of fumbling, of sitting with our own limitations. That messiness isn’t just a hurdle; it’s often where the real insights hide. It’s where we meet ourselves, unfiltered, before the world gets to weigh in.

You’re not strange for feeling a little uneasy about this shift. Many people carry this quietly—a sense that something vital slips away when the process becomes too easy. This doesn’t mean something is wrong with using tools like AI, or that you’re behind for still valuing the slow, imperfect grind. It’s okay to notice the difference, to sit with it, to ask yourself what matters most in your own creative work.

If you’re feeling this tension, you don’t have to fix it immediately. Maybe it’s enough, for now, to name it—to recognize that the struggle of a first draft isn’t just a flaw to overcome, but a space where something uniquely yours is born. I’m curious how this lands with you, or if you’ve felt this loss in other ways. There’s no rush to figure it out. Just let the question breathe.

With peace,  
Randy
