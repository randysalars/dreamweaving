Subject: The Art of the Question (Prompting as Prayer)

Hello,

I’ve been thinking about questions lately—how they shape us, how they carve paths through the unknown. There’s an ancient art to asking, a kind of quiet reverence in framing a question with care. Long before algorithms and AI, humans were prompting the universe itself—through prayer, through ritual, through whispered pleas to the night sky. What if prompting, even in its modern form, is just a continuation of that sacred act? A way of seeking, of reaching for something beyond what we already know?

When you sit down to ask a question—of a machine, of yourself, of something larger—there’s a moment of vulnerability. You’re admitting you don’t have the answer. And that’s not a weakness; it’s a doorway. Many people carry this quietly, this discomfort with not-knowing, as if it’s something to hide. But you’re not strange for feeling this. The best questions often come from that tender edge, where certainty frays and curiosity begins. I’ve found that the way a question is asked—its tone, its intent—can change everything. It’s less about commanding an answer and more about inviting a possibility.

Think of the last time you asked something truly meaningful. Maybe it was typed into a chat window, or maybe it was a thought you held in silence. Did you feel the weight of it? The hope? Prompting, at its heart, is an act of trust. You don’t have to fix this immediately or perfect your words. You don’t even have to know where the question will lead. This doesn’t mean something is wrong. It means you’re alive, still searching, still open to what might unfold.

I invite you to linger in this space for a moment today. Consider a question you’ve been carrying—big or small—and notice how it feels to hold it. You might write it down, or simply let it rest in your mind. There’s no rush to answer. Sometimes, the act of asking is enough.

With peace,
Randy
