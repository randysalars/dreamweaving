Subject: The Weight of Watching AI Unfold

Hello,

I’ve been noticing how relentless the AI news cycle feels lately. Every day, there’s a new breakthrough, a new warning, a new promise—or a new fear. It’s easy to become a passive observer, caught in the current of endless updates and opinions, feeling like you’re supposed to have a stance or a plan right now. I’ve felt that pull myself, that quiet pressure to keep up or risk being left behind. But I want to pause here with you and say: you don’t have to dive in headfirst. You’re not strange for feeling overwhelmed by it all.

Many people carry this quietly—the sense that AI is reshaping everything, and yet, there’s no clear map for how to engage with it. It’s not just the technology; it’s the weight of what it means for our work, our creativity, our very sense of agency. This doesn’t mean something is wrong with you if you’re unsure or hesitant. It’s a natural response to something so vast and fast-moving. I’ve found myself stepping back lately, not to ignore it, but to ask: What do I truly need from this? How can I meet it on my terms, not the world’s?

I believe in intentional integration over blind adoption. Slow Business, as I see it, isn’t about rejecting progress or fearing change—it’s about choosing what serves your deeper why. Maybe that means exploring AI as a tool for your craft, or maybe it means setting boundaries around where it fits in your life. There’s no rush to figure this out. You don’t have to fix your relationship with AI immediately, or even this year. What matters is giving yourself the space to feel, to question, and to decide with care.

If you’re feeling the weight of watching AI unfold, know that you’re not alone in it. I’m here, too, navigating the same currents, reminding myself that presence matters more than pace. Take your time with this. Let the noise settle. You’ll find your way when it feels right.

With peace,  
Randy
