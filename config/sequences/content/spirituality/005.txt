Subject: Walking with Doubt and Faith

Hello,

I’ve been thinking a lot about doubt lately—not as an enemy, but as a quiet companion to faith. So often, we’re taught that doubt is a failing, a crack in the foundation of belief. But I’ve come to see it differently. Doubt, when held with honesty, can be a sign that your faith is alive, searching, and unafraid to ask the hard questions. You’re not strange for feeling this tension; it’s a mark of depth.

Many people carry this quietly, the push and pull between certainty and uncertainty. I’ve felt it myself—those nights when the big questions loom larger than any answers, when the spiritual path feels more like a winding trail than a straight road. And I’ve learned that this doesn’t mean something is wrong. Doubt isn’t a detour; it’s often the very thing that deepens our understanding, that strips away easy platitudes and leaves us with something truer.

If you’re in a season of doubt, I want to offer you permission to let it be there. You don’t have to fix this immediately or force yourself into a certainty that doesn’t feel real. Sit with it. Ask your questions. Let faith and doubt walk side by side for a while. I’ve found that faith grows stronger not by silencing doubt, but by listening to it, by letting it teach you what you’re really reaching for.

I’m here, reflecting on these things with you, not to provide all the answers but to share the journey. If this resonates, or if you’re carrying your own questions, know that there’s space for them here.

With peace,
Randy
