Subject: When the Spiritual Path Feels Empty

Hello,

There are times on the spiritual journey when the light seems to dim, when the practices or beliefs that once felt so alive turn quiet, even hollow. Some call this a "dark night of the soul," but it doesn’t have to be dramatic or terrifying. It’s often just a stillness—a space where the old ways of connecting don’t work anymore, and the new hasn’t yet arrived. You’re not strange for feeling this. Many walk through these seasons without naming them, carrying the weight of wondering if they’ve lost something essential.

This dryness isn’t a sign of failure or a signal that you’ve strayed. It’s more like fallow ground—land resting before it can grow again. I’ve been there myself, staring at the rituals or words that used to move me, feeling nothing but a quiet ache. What I’ve learned is that this emptiness isn’t something to fix immediately. It’s an invitation to sit with what’s true right now, even if that truth is uncertainty or grief. You don’t have to rush to fill the void with answers or force a connection that isn’t there.

What often emerges from these times, if we let them unfold, is a deeper kind of knowing. Not the kind that comes from books or teachings, but the kind carved out of your own silence. Maybe you’ll find that what you once clung to no longer fits, and that’s okay. Or maybe you’ll rediscover it in a way that feels more authentic, more yours. This doesn’t mean something is wrong with where you are. It’s just a chapter of unbecoming before becoming again.

If you’re in this place, give yourself permission to be still with it. You don’t need to perform spirituality or prove your depth to anyone, including yourself. Just let the quiet be what it is. I’m here, walking my own winding path, and I’m glad to share this space with you, however it feels for you right now.

With peace,  
Randy
