Subject: The Wisdom of Tradition

Hello,

I’ve been thinking lately about the old masters—those who walked spiritual paths long before us, leaving behind teachings, rituals, and stories that still hum with life. Whether it’s the quiet discipline of a Zen koan, the poetic depth of Rumi, or the grounded wisdom of indigenous elders, there’s something steadying in knowing that others have wrestled with the same questions we carry. Their words and ways can feel like a hand on the shoulder, reminding us we’re not alone in seeking meaning. You’re not strange for feeling drawn to these traditions, even if you don’t fully understand why.

But here’s what I’ve come to see: while the masters offer maps, they don’t own the journey. Their wisdom is a gift, not a rulebook. I’ve sat with ancient texts and practices myself, feeling both humbled and overwhelmed, wondering if I’m “doing it right.” And over time, I’ve realized that the real invitation isn’t to mimic their path exactly—it’s to listen deeply and let their insights mingle with your own voice. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you adapt or question. It means you’re alive, shaping a spirituality that’s true to who you are.

Many people carry this quietly, this tension between honoring tradition and trusting their own inner compass. There’s no need to resolve it quickly or choose one over the other. Let the old ways teach you, but don’t let them silence you. If a ritual feels heavy, set it down for a while. If a teaching sparks something in you, follow that light, even if it leads somewhere unexpected. You don’t have to fix this balance immediately—it’s a slow dance, one worth taking your time with.

I hope you’ll give yourself permission to learn from the masters without losing yourself in the process. Their wisdom is vast, but so is yours.

With peace,  
Randy
