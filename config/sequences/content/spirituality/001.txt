Subject: Entering the Quiet

Hello,

There’s a kind of silence that isn’t just the absence of noise—it’s a presence, a space where something deeper can emerge. I’ve found myself drawn to these moments more and more over the years, especially when the world feels loud and relentless. It’s not about escaping, but about listening. There’s a voice within each of us, often drowned out by the hum of daily life, that only reveals itself when we step into the quiet.

You might have felt this too—a pull toward stillness, even if it’s unfamiliar or uncomfortable at first. Many people carry this quietly, unsure if it’s okay to seek out silence in a world that rewards constant motion. You’re not strange for feeling this. It’s not a sign of weakness or avoidance; it’s a sign that something in you is asking to be heard. This doesn’t mean something is wrong. It just means there’s a part of you ready to speak, if you’re willing to listen.

I’ve learned that entering the quiet isn’t about forcing anything. It can be as simple as sitting with a cup of tea, letting the steam curl upward, noticing the way your breath slows. Or stepping outside to feel the air on your skin, without a goal or agenda. It’s not about achieving some grand spiritual state—it’s about giving yourself permission to be, just for a moment. You don’t have to fix this immediately or turn it into a practice. Just let it be a door you can open when you’re ready.

If this resonates, I invite you to notice the quiet spaces already in your life, however small they might seem. A pause between tasks, a moment before sleep. What do you hear there? I’m not here to tell you what it should mean, only to remind you that this space is yours to explore, at your own pace.

With peace,  
Randy
