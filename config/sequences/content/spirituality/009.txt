Subject: The Unnameable Mystery

Hello,

There’s something about the divine—whatever you call it, if you call it anything at all—that refuses to be fully captured. It slips through our words, our definitions, our neat little boxes. I’ve spent countless hours in my life trying to name it, to pin it down with a concept or a story, only to find that the moment I think I’ve got it, it’s gone again. And I’ve come to see that this isn’t a failing. It’s the nature of the thing itself. You’re not strange for feeling this pull toward something vast and unknowable, nor for struggling to articulate it.

Many people carry this quietly—this sense of a presence or a force that’s both intimate and utterly beyond us. It can feel isolating, especially in a world that often demands certainty or proof. But there’s a kind of beauty in not knowing, isn’t there? In sitting with the mystery without needing to solve it. This doesn’t mean something is wrong if you don’t have all the answers, or if your understanding shifts with time. The divine, or whatever name feels true to you, doesn’t seem to mind our fumbling. It meets us in the questions as much as in the rare moments of clarity.

I’ve found, in my own weaving of dreams and stories, that the most profound experiences often come when I stop trying to define and start simply being with what is. A quiet walk at dusk, the sound of wind through leaves, a sudden ache of longing for something I can’t name—these are doorways. Not answers, but invitations. You don’t have to fix this immediately, or ever, if you don’t want to. You can let the mystery be mysterious, and trust that it’s okay to rest in the not-knowing.

If you’ve ever felt this too, I’d love to hear how it shows up for you—though there’s no pressure to share. I’m just here, listening, and walking this winding path alongside you.

With peace,  
Randy
