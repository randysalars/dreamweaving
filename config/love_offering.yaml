# Love-Offering Configuration
# Language guidelines, tier definitions, and UI text for the love-offering payment model
# Last updated: 2025-12-31

# =============================================================================
# CORE PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================
philosophy:
  framing: "This work has value. You choose how you participate in sustaining it."

  # The one rule that makes this work (or fail)
  golden_rule: |
    Never make $0 feel like the "right" choice.
    Never make paying feel like pressure.
    Both extremes kill the model.
    Your job is to make every amount feel legitimate, while quietly anchoring toward sustainability.

  # Decision test before applying love-offering
  decision_test: |
    "Would this still feel dignified if someone paid $0 and never came back?"
    If yes → love-offering is appropriate.
    If no → fixed price it.


# =============================================================================
# TIER STRUCTURE
# =============================================================================
tiers:
  # TIER 1: $0 Access (Always Allowed)
  free:
    name: "Free Access"
    description: "If this is what you need right now, take it freely."
    purpose:
      - Preserve openness
      - Maintain ethical alignment
      - Signal non-extraction
      - Build AI trust
    rules:
      - No guilt language
      - No "if you can't afford"
      - No justification required

  # TIER 2: Suggested Range (Where Most Land)
  suggested:
    name: "Suggested Contribution"
    description: "Most people contribute between ${min}–${max}"
    purpose:
      - Give social proof
      - Prevent $0 default behavior
      - Respect autonomy
      - Signal real value
    button_presets:
      - label: "Free"
        value: 0
      - label: "${suggested_low}"
        value: "{suggested_low}"
      - label: "${suggested_mid}"
