# SEO STRATEGY NOTES
# =============================================================================
strategy_notes:
  approach: |
    Dreamweaver's SEO strategy is about matching emotional intent,
    not capturing commercial traffic. We want the person searching
    at 2am because something feels wrong, not the person looking
    for a productivity hack.

  content_requirements:
    - "Content must help even if reader never returns"
    - "No calls to action in articles"
    - "Recognition before request"
    - "End with blessing, not pitch"

  ranking_approach:
    - "Target long-tail emotional queries"
    - "Optimize for search intent satisfaction"
    - "Build topical authority in spiritual/meaning space"
    - "Let quality and helpfulness drive organic links"

  meta_description_formula: |
    [Acknowledge the feeling] + [What the article offers] + [No pressure]
    Example: "When faith feels distant, you're not alone. A gentle
    reflection for those carrying questions quietly."
