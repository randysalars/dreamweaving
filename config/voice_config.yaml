  VOICE SELECTION GUIDE:

  For most sessions, use the 'default' profile (en-US-Neural2-A).

  To select a voice programmatically:
    from scripts.config.voice_config import get_voice_profile
    profile = get_voice_profile('warm_male')
    voice_name = profile['name']

  Voice characteristics by type:
    - Female voices: Better for nurturing, healing, emotional work
    - Male voices: Better for grounding, authority, transformation
    - Deeper voices: Better for deep trance states
    - Clearer voices: Better for confidence, empowerment

  IMPORTANT:
    - Always use Google Cloud TTS for production
    - Edge TTS is deprecated and should not be used
    - Test voices before full session generation
