notes: |
  VOICE SELECTION GUIDE:

  For most sessions, use the 'default' profile (en-US-Neural2-F).
  For deep trance/sleep, use 'deep_female' profile (en-US-Neural2-E).

  To select a voice programmatically:
    from scripts.config.voice_config import get_voice_profile
    profile = get_voice_profile('warm_male')
    voice_name = profile['name']

  Voice characteristics by type:
    - Female voices: Better for nurturing, healing, emotional work
    - Male voices: Better for grounding, authority, transformation
    - Deeper voices: Better for deep trance states
    - Clearer voices: Better for confidence, empowerment

  HYPNOTIC PACING APPROACH:
    - Use 1.0x speaking rate (normal speed)
    - Control pacing through SSML breaks, NOT slow speech
    - Minimum break: 700ms (after phrases)
    - Medium break: 900ms (between ideas)
    - Long break: 1200ms+ (between sections)
    - Add commas before breaks for natural endings
    - Use ellipsis (...) for breath counts and countdowns

  IMPORTANT:
    - Always use Google Cloud TTS for production
    - Edge TTS is deprecated and should not be used
    - Test voices before full session generation
