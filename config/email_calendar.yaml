# DREAMWEAVER 12-MONTH EMAIL RHYTHM
# =============================================================================
#
# Philosophy: "We write when there is something worth sitting with."
#
# Core Rules (Non-Negotiable):
# - 1 email every 7-14 days
# - Some months = 1 email only
# - Ritual emails override cadence
# - Silence is intentional, not failure
# - Invitations appear only after trust is reinforced
#
# Think: monastic bell schedule, not campaign calendar.
#
# Annual Total: ~18-22 emails (half of most newsletters, twice the trust)
