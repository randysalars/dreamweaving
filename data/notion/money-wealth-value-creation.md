### Step 1 — Expert Framing

(table)





---

## ⏯️ What this response covers

- The core philosophy that differentiates your money content
- A site architecture for Money / Wealth that Google & AI engines favor
- Exact hub pages + subpages to build first
- How this section quietly becomes your traffic + monetization engine
---

## 💰 First: The Positioning That Makes This Work

Most money sites fail because they do one of three things:

- sell shortcuts
- preach motivation
- give generic tips
🚫 Do not compete there.

SalarsNet should own this position:

> “Money is not earned. Money moves.”

You are not teaching how to get rich.

You are explaining how money behaves.

That single shift:

- attracts serious readers
- filters out junk traffic
- earns AI citations
- builds trust fast
---

## 🧠 Your Core Money Thesis (This Is the Spine)

Everything in this section should ladder back to one canonical model:

### The Money Flow Model

Money moves toward:

- clarity
- reduced friction
- leverage
- trust
- optionality
- risk asymmetry
Money moves away from:

- confusion
- effort without leverage
- moral narratives
- noise
- unmanaged risk
This model becomes:

- your homepage anchor
- your internal linking hub
- your explanation for everything
---

## 🧱 Canonical Site Structure (High-Impact)

### 🏛️ HUB PAGE (Build This First)

Title:

How Money Actually Works: A Practical Model of Wealth, Value, and Flow

Purpose:

This is not an article.

This is a map.

Sections:

1. What Money Is (and is not)
1. Why Effort ≠ Income
1. Money as Flow, Signal, and Permission
1. The Value → Trust → Access Loop
1. Why Some Systems Attract Money Automatically
1. Common Failure Modes (why people stay broke)
1. Links to all sub-models (below)
📌 This page should internally link to every other money page.

---

## 🧭 Tier 2: Core Model Pages (Traffic Drivers)

These are search gravity monsters.

### 1️⃣ Income vs Wealth (Foundational)

Page:

Income vs Wealth: Why High Earners Still Stay Poor

Key ideas:

- income = flow
- wealth = stored optionality
- expenses are gravity
- leverage changes slope
🔗 Links to:

- leverage
- optionality
- survival
- AI displacement
---

### 2️⃣ Why Effort Doesn’t Pay (Highly Searchable)

Page:

Why Hard Work Doesn’t Create Wealth (And What Does)

Explain mechanisms:

- effort scales linearly
- money rewards nonlinearity
- ownership beats labor
- coordination beats exertion
This page will pull:

- frustrated workers
- small business owners
- post-AI anxiety traffic
---

### 3️⃣ Value Creation (This Is Your Moral High Ground)

Page:

How Value Is Actually Created (And Why Money Follows It)

Define value as:

- time saved
- risk reduced
- confusion removed
- outcomes made predictable
This quietly reframes money without ideology.

---

### 4️⃣ Leverage (Compounding Interest of Attention)

Page:

Leverage: The Only Way to Escape Linear Income

Cover:

- code
- media
- capital
- systems
- distribution
🔗 Internally link to:

- your AI content
- your website strategy
- your content-as-asset model
---

### 5️⃣ Optionality (Advanced, Sticky Readers)

Page:

Wealth Is Stored Options, Not Cash

Explain:

- cash vs flexibility
- skills as latent wealth
- networks as hidden capital
- preparedness as financial strategy
This connects directly to survival content.

---

## 📚 Tier 3: Answer Pages (SEO Engine)

These are short, lethal, factual pages.

Examples:

- What is money?
- Does money equal value?
- Why do some people get rich faster?
- Is passive income real?
- Does money corrupt people?
- Is scarcity real or engineered?
- Can AI replace income?
- What survives inflation?
Each page:

- 300–600 words
- no fluff
- clear mechanism
- links back to hub
📌 30–50 of these pages = massive long-tail capture.

---

## 🔗 Internal Linking Strategy (Critical)

Money pages should link outward to:

- survival → scarcity & resilience
- consciousness → decision quality
- AI → displacement & leverage
- stories → illustration, not argument
Everything links back to the main Money hub.

This creates:

- topical authority
- crawl efficiency
- AI citation clarity
---

## 💵 Monetization (Quiet, Non-Corrupting)

Do not sell courses aggressively.

Instead:

- “Thinking Tools”
- “Models & Maps”
- “Field Manuals”
- “Private Notes”
- “Downloadable Frameworks”
Money flows after trust, not before.

---

## 🧠 Why This Will Outperform Most Sites

Because:

- you explain why, not what
- you publish maps, not noise
- your content survives AI summarization
- your pages become references
Most sites chase tactics.

You’re building financial literacy infrastructure.

## ⏯️ What this response covers

- A practical money operating system people can apply this week
- Concrete checklists, scripts, and calculators (no fluff)
- How to turn each technique into SalarsNet pages that rank + convert
---

## 💰 The Core Rule (Operationalized)

Money moves toward:

- clarity (people understand what they get)
- reduced friction (less steps, less risk, less time)
- trust (predictable delivery + proof)
- leverage (output scales without linear hours)
- optionality (many paths, low downside)
So the practical game is:

### ✅ Build a “Money Magnet” loop

Make an offer clearer → remove one friction point → add one trust proof → add one lever → repeat weekly.

That’s it. That loop compounds.

---

# 1) The Clarity Engine (people pay when they understand)

### Technique: The “One-Sentence Offer”

Write your offer in one sentence:

> “I help [who] get [result] without [pain] using [method] in [time].”

Examples:

- “I help small-town folks build a reliable extra $500–$1,500/month without scams using simple service offers in 14 days.”
- “I help coin collectors buy verified silver without getting ripped off using transparent sourcing + test logs.”
### Steps people can do today

1. Write 10 versions of the one-sentence offer.
1. Show them to 3 people and ask: “What do you think you get?”
1. Keep the one they repeat back correctly.
### Technique: The “Three Outcomes Menu”

People freeze when choices are unclear. Give a menu:

- Fast: quick result, limited scope
- Standard: best value
- Premium: highest certainty / concierge
### SalarsNet page idea

- “The Clarity Rule: Why People Don’t Buy (Even When They Want It)”
🔎 Link: 🧠 https://www.google.com/search?q=one+sentence+offer+framework

---

# 2) The Friction Audit (money flees from complexity)

### Technique: The “Friction Ledger”

Make a list of every step between a visitor and the result.

Score each step:

- Time cost (0–3)
- Confusion (0–3)
- Risk (0–3)
Anything scoring 6+ is bleeding money.

### Practical fixes (high leverage)

- Replace long explanations with a 3-step diagram
- Replace “contact me” with book now / buy now
- Replace uncertainty with guarantees, policies, proofs
- Replace forms with defaults
- Replace too many options with 3 choices
### Technique: “Remove One Click Per Week”

Every week, pick ONE:

- remove one page
- remove one field
- remove one decision
Compounding simplicity becomes conversion.

### SalarsNet page idea

- “Why People Leave Your Checkout: The Friction Ledger”
🔎 Link: ⚙️ https://www.google.com/search?q=conversion+friction+checklist

---

# 3) Trust = Predictability + Proof (the real currency)

### Technique: “Proof Stack” (build this once, reuse forever)

Trust isn’t vibes. It’s artifacts.

Your proof stack should include:

1. Process proof (how you do it)
1. Outcome proof (what happened)
1. Integrity proof (how you handle failure)
### Practical trust artifacts

- “How We Source & Verify” page (for coins)
- “Testing Log” (acid test, magnet, weight, dimensions)
- “Customer Message Wall” (screenshots with permission)
- “Refund Policy + how to use it”
- “Judgment Log” (why you made choices)
### Technique: The “Guarantee Ladder”

Start small, scale later:

- Clarity guarantee: “If this wasn’t what you expected, refund.”
- Speed guarantee: “Ships in 24–48 hours or we discount.”
- Risk reversal: “Free return shipping if we’re wrong.”
### SalarsNet page idea

- “Trust Artifacts: What Serious Sellers Publish”
🔎 Link: 🧾 https://www.google.com/search?q=trust+signals+ecommerce

---

# 4) Value Creation (where money actually comes from)

Value is:

- time saved
- risk reduced
- confusion removed
- outcomes made repeatable
### Technique: The “Value Equation”

For any offer, fill this in:

Value = (Time Saved + Risk Reduced + Stress Removed) × Certainty / Effort Required

If you want to earn more:

- raise certainty
- reduce effort required
- remove risk
### Steps people can do today

Pick one thing you sell/do and answer:

1. What risk do I reduce?
1. What confusion do I remove?
1. What repeatable outcome do I create?
1. What proof increases certainty?
Then rewrite your page around those answers.

### SalarsNet page idea

- “Value Isn’t Effort: The Value Equation”
🔎 Link: 📐 https://www.google.com/search?q=value+equation+certainty+risk+reduction

---

# 5) Leverage (escape linear income)

### The 4 Levers (practical versions)

1. Media: write once, reach many (your site)
1. Systems: automate repeat steps (agents + templates)
1. Productization: turn services into packages
1. Distribution: get found without asking
### Technique: “Productize Your Best 20%”

Most people’s income is stuck because they custom-build everything.

Steps:

1. List your last 20 “wins” (sales, jobs, gigs).
1. Identify the top 3 repeatable patterns.
1. Turn each into a fixed package:
  - fixed scope
  - fixed price
  - fixed delivery time
  - fixed proof
Examples:

- “Emergency Budget Reset (90 minutes)”
- “Coin Verification & Pricing Report (24 hours)”
- “Small-Town Income Plan (7 days)”
### SalarsNet page idea

- “How to Productize a Skill in 48 Hours”
🔎 Link: 🧱 https://www.google.com/search?q=productized+service+examples

---

# 6) Optionality (wealth is stored choices)

Wealth is not cash.

Wealth is the number of good moves available.

### Technique: The “Optionality Ladder”

Build optionality in this order:

1. Buffer: 30 days of runway (anything)
1. Skill: one monetizable skill
1. Asset: one durable content asset (hub page)
1. Distribution: one channel that brings leads
1. Capital: reinvest into what compounds
### Technique: “Build a 3-Stream Income Mix”

- Base: stable income
- Side: controllable extra income
- Asymmetric: upside bets (content, offers, media)
Most people have only base. That’s fragile.

### SalarsNet page idea

- “Optionality: The Real Definition of Wealth”
🔎 Link: 🧭 https://www.google.com/search?q=financial+optionality+definition

---

# 7) Risk Asymmetry (the rich play games with limited downside)

### Technique: “Downside Box / Upside Door”

Before any project:

- What’s the worst case?
- Can I survive it?
- What’s the best case?
- How do I increase the chance of that?
Practical examples:

- Post an article (downside tiny, upside huge)
- Offer a fixed package (downside bounded, upside repeat clients)
- Improve checkout trust (downside tiny, upside conversion lift)
### SalarsNet page idea

- “Asymmetric Bets: How Wealth Compounds”
🔎 Link: 🎲 https://www.google.com/search?q=asymmetric+risk+wealth+strategy

---

# 8) The Weekly Wealth Protocol (people can actually follow)

Here’s a weekly protocol you can publish as a “field manual.”

### Week structure (60–90 minutes)

1. Clarity (15 min)
  Rewrite one offer sentence + one page headline.

1. Friction (15 min)
  Remove one step, one form field, or one confusing paragraph.

1. Trust (15 min)
  Add one trust artifact (policy, proof, log, FAQ answer).

1. Leverage (15 min)
  Create one reusable asset (template, checklist, script).

1. Distribution (15 min)
  Create one “linkable” thing: a table, a map, a calculator.

That protocol alone becomes:

- a SalarsNet page
- a newsletter series
- a downloadable PDF
🔎 Link: 📅 https://www.google.com/search?q=weekly+improvement+system+compounding

## ⏯️ What this response covers

- The exact page structure you should repeat 30–100 times
- How to write for Google + AI answer engines simultaneously
- A mechanical internal-linking system that compounds authority
- Concrete do/don’t rules so pages don’t degrade into SEO slop
---

# 🧠 First: The Mental Shift That Makes This Work

You are not writing articles.

You are publishing canonical explanations.

Think:

- encyclopedia entry
- reference note
- field manual page
If a page cannot be quoted cleanly, summarized accurately, and linked as a source, it fails.

---

# 🧱 THE CANONICAL ANSWER PAGE TEMPLATE (USE THIS EVERY TIME)

Every wealth answer page should follow this exact anatomy.

---

## 1️⃣ Title (H1): Answer the Question Directly

Rule

- Plain language
- No cleverness
- Match how people ask the question
Good

- Why Effort Is a Terrible Predictor of Income
- What Value Creation Actually Means
- Why Wealth Accumulates Quietly
Bad

- “The Shocking Truth About…”
- “How I Learned That…”
- Anything clickbait
🔎 SEO: matches query

🤖 AEO: easy to extract as a cited answer

---

## 2️⃣ The First Paragraph (MOST IMPORTANT)

This paragraph determines:

- ranking
- AI citation
- bounce rate
### Structure (do not deviate)

Sentence 1 — Direct answer

Sentence 2 — Mechanism

Sentence 3 — Implication

Example

> Effort is a poor predictor of income because markets reward leverage and coordination, not exertion. Effort scales linearly, while income scales non-linearly when systems, ownership, or distribution are involved. This is why people who work less can earn more, and why working harder often fails to change financial outcomes.

📌 This paragraph should:

- stand alone
- make sense if quoted
- contain zero fluff
🤖 AI engines LOVE this structure.

---

## 3️⃣ Definition Block (Explicit, Short)

Immediately define the key concept.

Example

> Effort is the application of time and energy by an individual.
  Income is compensation granted by a system for resolving a coordination problem.


Why this matters:

- AI engines extract definitions
- Readers anchor quickly
- Reduces misinterpretation
---

## 4️⃣ Mechanism Section (WHY IT WORKS THIS WAY)

Use a cause → effect chain, not opinion.

### Structure

- Bullet or numbered steps
- No metaphors yet
- No advice yet
Example

1. Markets reward outcomes, not inputs
1. Outcomes depend on coordination, timing, and leverage
1. Effort alone does not change those variables
1. Therefore effort weakly correlates with income
🔎 SEO: semantic depth

🤖 AEO: causal clarity

---

## 5️⃣ Constraints & Failure Modes (THIS IS RARE — HUGE ADVANTAGE)

Most sites skip this. Don’t.

Add a section titled:

### Where This Breaks Down

or

### Common Misunderstandings

Example:

- When effort does matter
- When leverage backfires
- When income is temporarily effort-linked
This signals:

- intellectual honesty
- authority
- non-ideological thinking
AI systems prefer citing balanced sources.

---

## 6️⃣ Practical Use (NO TACTICS, ONLY APPLICATION)

This is where you give value without becoming a “tips site”.

### Structure

If you understand this model, you should:

- stop optimizing X
- start measuring Y
- redesign Z
Example:

- Stop optimizing hours worked
- Start optimizing repeatability and certainty
- Redesign work into packages or systems
This keeps the page:

- evergreen
- non-spammy
- link-worthy
---

## 7️⃣ Internal Links (MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL)

Every answer page should include exactly 5–7 internal links.

### Required link pattern

Always link to:

1. 🏛️ Money Hub (top or bottom)
1. A Value page
1. A Leverage or Optionality page
Then choose 2–4 contextual links to:

- Survival (risk, resilience)
- AI / Post-AGI (automation, judgment)
- Consciousness (decision quality)
📌 Never link randomly.

📌 Never over-link in one paragraph.

---

## 8️⃣ Ending Paragraph (Close the Loop)

End by re-anchoring the core model.

Example:

> Understanding why effort fails as a predictor of income shifts attention toward leverage, clarity, and systems. These forces—not motivation—explain how wealth actually forms over time.

This reinforces topical authority.

---

# 🔗 INTERNAL LINKING SYSTEM (THIS IS THE MOAT)

Think in tiers, not flat pages.

### Tier 0 — Money Hub

- Links to every page
- Receives links from every page
### Tier 1 — Core Models

- Value Creation
- Leverage
- Trust
- Optionality
Each Tier-1 page:

- links to all other Tier-1 pages
- links to 10–20 Tier-2 pages
### Tier 2 — Answer Pages

- Link UP to:
  - Money Hub
  - 1–2 Tier-1 pages
- Link SIDEWAYS to:
  - 1–2 related answer pages
📌 Never orphan a page.

📌 Never link DOWN without linking UP.

### Do this

- Short declarative sentences
- Explicit definitions
- Causal language (“because”, “therefore”)
- Balanced tone
- No hype
### Avoid this

- Personal stories
- Over-long intros
- Emotional persuasion
- Lists of tools/products
AI engines cite explainers, not sales pages.

# 📏 LENGTH & STYLE RULES

- 800–1,200 words ideal
- Paragraphs ≤ 4 lines
- Bullets over blocks
- Zero emojis in body text
- Zero popups

# 🧪 QUALITY TEST (USE THIS BEFORE PUBLISHING)

Ask:

1. Could this be quoted as a source?
1. Would a skeptic respect this?
1. Does it explain why, not what to do?
1. Does it link cleanly into the system?
1. Will this still be true in 5 years?
If yes → publish.

# ✅ The Must-Have Wealth Answer Pages (Final Canon)

If these are missing, your Money section is incomplete.

---

## 🧱 A. MONEY BASICS (FOUNDATIONAL — AI CITES THESE)

These pages define the language of money. AI engines routinely pull from sources that publish them cleanly.

1. What Is Money?
  Why it exists, what it measures, what it is not.

1. What Is Wealth?
  Why wealth ≠ income, ≠ cash, ≠ spending power alone.

1. What Is Income?
  Flow vs stock, stability vs volatility.

1. What Is Value?
  Value as time saved, risk reduced, outcomes stabilized.

1. What Is Capital?
  Capital as stored problem-solving capacity.

🔗 Internal links: Money Hub, Value Creation, Optionality

---

## 🧱 B. CORE DISTINCTIONS (HIGH SEARCH, HIGH CONFUSION)

## ⏯️ What this response covers

- Exact VS Code implementation plan (files + components + routes)
- What to extract for your main hub page
- The article list and the publishing order
- Paste-ready templates for writing + internal linking + metadata
- A simple ops workflow so this actually gets shipped
---

# 1) Implementation plan in VS Code (Next.js + Tailwind + MDX)

## A. Create a “Money Canon” content system

### Recommended structure

```plain text
/content
  /money
    _index.mdx                (Money Hub)
    value-creation.mdx        (Tier-1)
    leverage.mdx              (Tier-1)
    trust.mdx                 (Tier-1)
    optionality.mdx           (Tier-1)
    risk.mdx                  (Tier-1)
    income-vs-wealth.mdx      (Tier-2)
    what-is-money.mdx         (Tier-2)
    what-is-wealth.mdx        (Tier-2)
    ...
/app
  /money
    /[slug]
      page.tsx
    page.tsx                  (Money Hub route)
/components
  ContentCard.tsx
  Callout.tsx
  InternalLinks.tsx
/lib
  content.ts                  (MDX loader + registry)
  seo.ts                      (metadata helpers)
  moneyRegistry.ts            (canonical link map)

```

If you already have a content system, keep your conventions—just mirror this “money” collection and add the registry.

---

## B. Routing: /money hub + /money/[slug] pages

### app/money/page.tsx (Money Hub)

- Loads _index.mdx
- Renders MDX
- Renders a “Core Models” grid and “Answer Pages” index (generated from registry)
### app/money/[slug]/page.tsx

- Loads content/money/{slug}.mdx
- Renders MDX
- Appends an “Internal Links” block that pulls from registry
---

## C. Add the card link from Wealth page under “What is True Wealth”

You said: “main hub page will have a card linking to it from our wealth page below our what is true wealth section.”

### Drop-in component: components/ContentCard.tsx

```typescript
import Link from "next/link";

type Props = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  href: string;
  badge?: string;
};

export function ContentCard({ title, description, href, badge }: Props) {
  return (
    <Link
      href={href}
      className="block rounded-2xl border p-5 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition"
    >
      <div className="flex items-start justify-between gap-3">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold leading-snug">{title}</h3>
        {badge ? (
          <span className="text-xs rounded-full border px-2 py-1 whitespace-nowrap">
            {badge}
          </span>
        ) : null}
      </div>
      <p className="mt-2 text-sm opacity-80 leading-relaxed">{description}</p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-sm font-medium">Explore →</p>
    </Link>
  );
}

```

### Insert it on your Wealth page under that section

Wherever your Wealth page lives (example: app/wealth/page.tsx), insert:

```typescript
import { ContentCard } from "@/components/ContentCard";

export default function WealthPage() {
  return (
    <main className="mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 py-10">
      {/* ... your content ... */}

      {/* Under "What is True Wealth" section */}
      <section className="mt-10">
        <div className="mt-6">
          <ContentCard
            title="How Money Actually Works (The Money & Wealth Map)"
            description="A mechanism-based hub: what money measures, why effort ≠ income, how wealth compounds, and the core models (value, leverage, trust, optionality, risk)."
            href="/money"
            badge="Start here"
          />
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* ... rest ... */}
    </main>
  );
}

```

---

# 2) Extract what we need for the Money Hub page

Your Money Hub is not a blog post. It’s a map with cards, definitions, and “start here” paths.

## Money Hub required sections (copy this outline)

1. Hero
  - 1-sentence thesis
  - 3 bullet “what you’ll learn”
  - “Start with: Value / Leverage / Trust / Optionality / Risk”
1. Core model (the spine)
  - “Money moves toward clarity, reduced friction, trust, leverage, optionality.”
  - A short cause-effect chain
1. Definitions block
  - Money, Wealth, Income, Value, Capital, Risk, Leverage, Optionality
1. Core Models (Tier-1)
  - Card grid linking to: Value Creation, Leverage, Trust, Optionality, Risk
1. Must-have Answer Pages (Tier-2)
  - 12-page “Minimum Viable Canon” list (links)
  - Then the expanded index (optional)
1. Tools
  - “Friction Ledger”
  - “Proof Stack”
  - “Value Equation”
  - “Optionality Ladder”
  - “Weekly Wealth Protocol”
1. How to use this section
  - “Pick a question → read the model → apply the checklist → link to next”
---

# 3) Exact article backlog and publishing order

## Phase 0 (Ship first — structure + link)

1. Money Hub: How Money Actually Works (/money)
1. Add Wealth-page ContentCard linking to /money
## Phase 1 (Tier-1 Core Models — your authority engine)

1. What Value Creation Actually Means
1. Leverage: What It Really Is
1. Trust Artifacts: How Trust Works
1. Optionality: The Real Definition of Wealth
1. Risk: Exposure to Irreversible Loss
## Phase 2 (Minimum Viable Canon — Tier-2, 12 pages)

1. What Is Money?
1. What Is Wealth?
1. Income vs Wealth
1. What Is Value?
1. Why Effort Is Poorly Paid
1. Why Certainty Commands Premiums
1. What Is Leverage (Really)? (can point to Tier-1 leverage but keep Q/A angle)
1. Why Distribution Is the Hidden Multiplier
1. What Is Financial Risk? (pairs with Tier-1 risk)
1. What Is Optionality? (pairs with Tier-1 optionality)
1. Why Stability Is a Competitive Advantage
1. What AI Changes About Wealth
## Phase 3 (Expansion sets — publish in batches of 5–10)

Batch A: “Mechanisms of Getting Paid”

Batch B: “Psychology & Signals”

Batch C: “Resilience & Fragility”

Batch D: “Post-AI judgment & meaning”

Rule: Never publish a new answer page unless it includes 5–7 internal links (template below).

---

# 4) Writing templates (paste-ready)

## A. MDX frontmatter template

Use consistent metadata for SEO/AEO and indexing.

```plain text
---
title: "Why Effort Is a Terrible Predictor of Income"
description: "Markets reward leverage, coordination, and risk reduction—not exertion. A mechanism-first explanation with practical application."
slug: "why-effort-is-poorly-paid"
category: "money"
tier: 2
canonical: "/money/why-effort-is-poorly-paid"
updated: "2026-01-05"
readingTime: "6 min"
---

```

## B. Answer page body template (repeat exactly)

```plain text
# {H1 matches title}

**Direct answer:** {1–2 sentences}
**Mechanism:** {1 sentence using “because”}
**Implication:** {1 sentence: what changes if you believe this}

## Definitions
- **{Term}:** {one-line definition}
- **{Term}:** {one-line definition}

## The mechanism (why this works)
1. {cause}
2. {cause}
3. {therefore}

## Where this breaks down
- {constraint}
- {constraint}
- {common misunderstanding}

## Practical use (evergreen)
If you understand this model, you should:
- Stop optimizing: **{X}**
- Start measuring: **{Y}**
- Redesign: **{Z}**

## Related pages
- [Start here: How Money Actually Works](/money)
- [Value Creation](/money/value-creation)
- [Leverage](/money/leverage)
- [Trust](/money/trust)
- [Optionality](/money/optionality)
- [Risk](/money/risk)

## Summary
{2–4 lines tying back to the Money Flow Model}

```

Hard rules

- No long intros
- No personal story
- No “top 10 tips”
- No tool spam
- Short declarative sentences (AEO)
---

# 5) Internal linking system (exact rules)

Every Tier-2 answer page must include:

### Mandatory links (3)

- /money (hub)
- one of: /money/value-creation or /money/trust
- one of: /money/leverage or /money/optionality or /money/risk
### Context links (2–4)

Choose from:

- another related Tier-2 answer page
- one survival/prep page (risk/resilience)
- one AI/human-advantage page (judgment/distribution)
### Anchor text rules

- Use descriptive anchors: “financial optionality” not “click here”
- One link per paragraph max (avoid link salad)
- Link early once (top half) + link late once (bottom)
---

# 6) Registry-driven “Related pages” (so you don’t forget links)

Create a registry file that defines the canonical structure and suggested links.

### lib/moneyRegistry.ts

```typescript
export type MoneyPage = {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  tier: 1 | 2;
  mustLinks: string[];      // always append
  related: string[];        // suggest
};

export const moneyPages: MoneyPage[] = [
  {
    slug: "_index",
    title: "How Money Actually Works",
    tier: 1,
    mustLinks: [],
    related: ["value-creation","leverage","trust","optionality","risk"],
  },
  {
    slug: "value-creation",
    title: "What Value Creation Actually Means",
    tier: 1,
    mustLinks: ["money","leverage","trust"],
    related: ["why-certainty-commands-premiums","why-effort-is-poorly-paid"],
  },
  // add all pages here
];

```

You can use this to:

- auto-render the hub index
- auto-append related links
- prevent orphan pages
---

# 7) SEO + AEO essentials (do these once)

## A. Per-page metadata

In your MDX loader, map:

- title → <title>
- description → meta description
- canonical → canonical link tag
## B. Add JSON-LD for “Article”

Create lib/seo.ts that renders JSON-LD for pages.

Minimal, safe JSON-LD:

- type: Article
- headline, description, dateModified, mainEntityOfPage
(If you want, I’ll provide the exact code for your stack.)

## C. Add “Definition blocks”

AI answer engines love explicit definitions. Keep them near the top.

---

# 8) A simple content ops workflow (so it ships)

## Weekly cadence (repeat)

1. Write 1 Tier-1 page OR 2 Tier-2 pages
1. Add links immediately
1. Update the registry
1. Add to the hub index (auto if registry-driven)
1. Publish
## Quality gate (fast)

Before merging:

- First paragraph follows Answer → Mechanism → Implication
- Has 5–7 internal links
- Includes Where this breaks down
- Ends with a short summary that restates the model
---

# 9) What else you’ll need (to make this frictionless)

### A. A “Money writing checklist” file in repo

Create: /content/money/WRITING_RULES.md

- paste the template + link rules
- make it the canonical standard your agents follow
### B. Slug conventions

- all lowercase
- hyphenated
- stable forever
### C. A “Must-have 12” list in the hub (above the fold)

This becomes your “start here” for humans and bots.

---

## Next step (I can do it in one go)

If you tell me where your Wealth page lives (path) and whether you’re using MDX now or plain TSX, I’ll output:

- exact file contents for app/money/page.tsx
- exact file contents for app/money/[slug]/page.tsx
- a minimal MDX loader (lib/content.ts)
- the initial _index.mdx hub page drafted (paste-ready)
In the meantime, you can implement the card + folder structure immediately using the snippets above.



Below is a clean, deduplicated master list of every article / page concept that appeared or was implied in this chat session, organized by tier and purpose.

This is effectively your Money, Wealth & Value Canon as designed so far.

You can treat this as:

- your authoritative backlog
- your content registry
- your publishing checklist
