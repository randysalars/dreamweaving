## Internal Linking Matrix

### Hub → Categories
The hub page features an "Explore by Topic" section with 4 clickable cards linking to each category index.

### Categories → Answers
Each category page lists all its questions as clickable links with HelpCircle icons.

### Answers → Answers
Each answer page has 5 "Related Questions" linking to other answers (same-cluster priority).

### Answers → Categories
Each answer page has:
- Top breadcrumb: "← Back to [Category Name]"
- Footer link: "View all [Category Name] questions"

### Categories → Hub
Each category page has:
- Top breadcrumb: "← Back to Altered States"
- Footer link: "View all Altered States categories"

## Link Count Summary

| Page Type | Outbound Links |
|-----------|----------------|
| Hub | 4 (to categories) + existing methods |
| Category Index | 1 (to hub) + N (to answers) + 1 (footer to hub) |
| Answer Page | 1 (breadcrumb to category) + 5 (related questions) + 1 (footer to category) |

**Total Internal Links Created:** 83 links
- Hub to categories: 4
- Categories to hub: 8 (4 breadcrumbs + 4 footers)
- Categories to answers: 10
- Answers to categories: 20 (10 breadcrumbs + 10 footers)
- Answers to answers: 50 (10 pages × 5 related each) - note: some overlap

## SEO Benefits

1. **Shallow Depth**: All pages 2-3 clicks from hub
2. **Contextual Linking**: Related questions create semantic clusters
3. **Bidirectional Navigation**: Users can easily traverse up/down hierarchy
4. **Keyword Diversity**: 10 unique question-based URLs
5. **Internal Link Authority**: Hub distributes PageRank to categories, categories to answers

## User Journey Patterns

### Pattern 1: Browse by Category
```
Hub → Category Index → Specific Answer → Related Answer
```

### Pattern 2: Direct Entry (from Google)
```
Answer Page (from SERP) → Category Index → Other Answers → Hub
```

### Pattern 3: Deep Exploration
```
Hub → Category → Answer A → Related Answer B → Related Answer C → Back to Category
```

## Next Expansion Opportunities

### Remaining Altered States Questions (~114)
- Mechanisms & Neuroscience (cluster III-IV)
- Historical & Cultural (cluster V-VI)
- Therapeutic Applications (cluster VII-VIII)
- Phenomenology & Subjective States (cluster IX-X)
- Research & Documentation (cluster XI-XII)

### Other Topic Maps
- **Meditation** (120-180 questions across 8 clusters)
- **Memory Systems** (50-60 questions across 5 clusters)

### Total Potential
- Current: 14 pages (10 answers + 4 categories)
- Phase 2 (Altered States complete): ~124 answers + ~12 categories = 136 pages
- Phase 3 (All topics): ~250 answers + ~25 categories = 275 pages

## Build & Deployment Status

✅ All 14 pages compile without errors
✅ TypeScript validation passes
✅ Next.js build successful
✅ Semantic color tokens only (no hardcoded colors)
✅ Mobile responsive
✅ Dark/light mode compatible
✅ Ready for deployment

## Analytics Goals

Once deployed, track:
1. **Click-through rates** from hub to categories
2. **Time on page** for answer pages vs category pages
3. **Related question click-through** (which links get most engagement)
4. **Google impressions** for question-based queries
5. **Featured snippet captures** (AEO optimization target)
6. **Category bounce rates** (should be low with good internal linking)
