<!-- PRE-TALK (2 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Welcome to Intuition Activation. <break time="1.5s"/>

Beyond the analytical mind lies another way of knowing. <break time="1.5s"/>
Call it intuition... inner wisdom... gut feeling... or the still small voice within. <break time="2s"/>

This knowing doesn't rely on logic... it operates through pattern recognition, accumulated experience, and subtle awareness that your conscious mind often overlooks. <break time="2s"/>

This session will help you access and strengthen this intuitive capacity... learning to hear, trust, and act on your inner guidance. <break time="2s"/>

Close your eyes now. <break time="1.5s"/>

Let's awaken the intuitive mind.

<!-- INDUCTION (3 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Take a deep breath... drawing it down into your belly. <break time="3s"/>
Exhale slowly... releasing tension. <break time="3s"/>

Another breath... feeling yourself settle into receptive awareness. <break time="3s"/>

Your analytical mind can rest now. <break time="2s"/>
We're not asking it to figure anything out. <break time="2s"/>
We're asking it to step aside... to create space for a different kind of knowing. <break time="4s"/>

With each breath... you become more open... more receptive... more attuned to subtle information. <break time="4s"/>

Drift deeper now... into the realm of intuition.

<!-- JOURNEY: Intuition Awakening (13 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Imagine yourself descending into the center of your being. <break time="2s"/>

Moving past the busy surface thoughts... <break time="2s"/>
Past the emotions of the day... <break time="2s"/>
Past the concerns and plans... <break time="3s"/>

Going deeper... <break time="2s"/>
Into a quiet space that exists at your core. <break time="4s"/>

Here... at the center... there is stillness. <break time="3s"/>

And in this stillness... there is a presence. <break time="3s"/>

This is your intuitive self. <break time="2s"/>
The part of you that knows things before you can explain them. <break time="2s"/>
The part that picks up on subtleties. <break time="2s"/>
The part that sees patterns your conscious mind misses. <break time="4s"/>

Greet this intuitive presence within you. <break time="3s"/>
Acknowledge it. <break time="2s"/>
Thank it for always being there... even when you didn't notice. <break time="4s"/>

Now... your intuitive self has something to show you. <break time="3s"/>

Before you appears what looks like a pool of still water. <break time="2s"/>
Its surface is perfectly calm... reflecting nothing... yet containing everything. <break time="4s"/>

This is the pool of intuitive knowing. <break time="3s"/>

When you gaze into this pool with a question... images, feelings, or knowings will rise to the surface. <break time="3s"/>

The key is not to grasp... but to receive. <break time="2s"/>
Not to analyze... but to perceive. <break time="2s"/>
Not to force... but to allow. <break time="4s"/>

Let's practice. <break time="2s"/>

Think of something in your life where you'd like guidance. <break time="3s"/>
It might be a decision you're facing... a relationship... a project... anything where clarity would help. <break time="4s"/>

Hold this question lightly in your awareness. <break time="3s"/>

Now... gaze into the still pool... and simply wait. <break time="5s"/>

Notice what arises. <break time="3s"/>
It might come as an image... <break time="2s"/>
A feeling in your body... <break time="2s"/>
A word or phrase... <break time="2s"/>
A sudden knowing that seems to come from nowhere. <break time="4s"/>

Don't judge what comes. <break time="2s"/>
Don't analyze it yet. <break time="2s"/>
Simply receive it. <break time="5s"/>

Let the information settle into you. <break time="4s"/>

Your intuition often speaks in symbols... in metaphors... in feelings. <break time="3s"/>
The meaning may become clear later. <break time="3s"/>
For now... just register what you received. <break time="4s"/>

This pool is always available to you. <break time="3s"/>
In quiet moments... you can turn inward... find this still center... and consult your intuitive knowing. <break time="4s"/>

The more you practice... the clearer the messages become. <break time="3s"/>
The more you trust... the stronger your intuition grows. <break time="4s"/>

Your intuitive self wants to communicate with you. <break time="2s"/>
It has been waiting for you to listen. <break time="4s"/>

Make a commitment now to pay attention. <break time="2s"/>
When you get a gut feeling... notice it. <break time="2s"/>
When something just feels right or wrong... honor that feeling. <break time="2s"/>
When you dream... pay attention to the messages. <break time="4s"/>

Your intuition is a gift. <break time="2s"/>
Today... you've begun to unwrap it more fully.
</prosody>
<break time="5s"/>

<!-- CLOSING (2 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Begin to rise now from the center of your being. <break time="3s"/>

Carrying your strengthened intuitive connection with you. <break time="3s"/>

Feel your body... <break time="2s"/>
The room around you... <break time="2s"/>
The present moment. <break time="3s"/>

Take a deep breath. <break time="3s"/>

Wiggle your fingers and toes. <break time="2s"/>

When you open your eyes... know that your intuition is more accessible than ever before. <break time="3s"/>

Listen to it. <break time="2s"/>
Trust it. <break time="2s"/>

Open your eyes now. <break time="2s"/>

Welcome back.
