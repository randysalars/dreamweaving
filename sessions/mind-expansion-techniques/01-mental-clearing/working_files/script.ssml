Welcome to Mental Clearing... the foundation of mind expansion. <break time="1.5s"/>

Before we can expand the mind... we must first clear it. <break time="1s"/>
Like cleaning a lens before looking through it... or clearing a workspace before creating. <break time="2s"/>

This fifteen-minute session will help you release mental clutter... quiet the noise of daily thoughts... and establish a clear, focused baseline from which all other mental work becomes possible. <break time="2s"/>

Find a comfortable position. <break time="1s"/>
Close your eyes when you're ready. <break time="1.5s"/>

Know that this session is safe... and you remain in complete control throughout.

<!-- INDUCTION (3 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Take a deep breath in... <break time="3s"/>
And let it go completely. <break time="3s"/>

Another breath... drawing in clarity... <break time="3s"/>
Exhaling everything you no longer need. <break time="3s"/>

Let your breathing settle into its own natural rhythm now. <break time="3s"/>

With each exhale... allow your body to become a little heavier... a little more relaxed. <break time="3s"/>

Your shoulders dropping... <break time="2s"/>
Your jaw softening... <break time="2s"/>
Your hands unclenching... <break time="3s"/>

There's nothing you need to do right now... nowhere you need to be... nothing you need to figure out. <break time="3s"/>

Just this moment... just this breath... just this gentle releasing.

<!-- JOURNEY: Mental Clearing (8 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Now imagine your mind as a room. <break time="2s"/>

A room that has accumulated many things over time... <break time="2s"/>
Thoughts like papers stacked on every surface... <break time="2s"/>
Worries like objects cluttering the floor... <break time="2s"/>
Mental noise like a radio playing in the background. <break time="3s"/>

Take a moment to observe this room without judgment. <break time="2s"/>
It's simply what has accumulated. <break time="3s"/>

Now... imagine a gentle wind beginning to blow through this room. <break time="3s"/>

Not a harsh wind... but a soft, warm breeze. <break time="2s"/>
A breeze that knows exactly what needs to stay... and what can go. <break time="4s"/>

Watch as the unnecessary papers begin to lift... <break time="2s"/>
Floating up and out through an open window... <break time="2s"/>
Carried away by the wind. <break time="3s"/>

Old worries you've been holding... lifting off... drifting away. <break time="3s"/>

Thoughts about the past that serve no purpose... released. <break time="3s"/>

Anxieties about the future... acknowledged... and let go. <break time="4s"/>

The wind continues... gentle but thorough. <break time="3s"/>

With each breath you take... more clutter lifts and floats away. <break time="4s"/>

The radio of mental noise grows quieter... <break time="2s"/>
And quieter still... <break time="2s"/>
Until there is only peaceful silence. <break time="4s"/>

The room is clearing now. <break time="2s"/>
Spacious. <break time="2s"/>
Open. <break time="2s"/>
Clean. <break time="4s"/>

What remains are only those things that truly matter... <break time="2s"/>
The essential thoughts... <break time="2s"/>
The core priorities... <break time="2s"/>
Your fundamental sense of self. <break time="4s"/>

Feel how much lighter your mind feels. <break time="3s"/>

Feel the space that exists now... <break time="2s"/>
Space for clarity... <break time="2s"/>
Space for creativity... <break time="2s"/>
Space for new possibilities. <break time="4s"/>

This cleared state is always available to you. <break time="2s"/>
You can return here whenever you need to. <break time="2s"/>
A simple breath... a moment of intention... and the clearing wind can blow again. <break time="4s"/>

Rest now in this clarity. <break time="3s"/>
Let it sink into you. <break time="3s"/>
Let it become your new baseline.
</prosody>
<break time="5s"/>

<!-- CLOSING (2 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Begin to bring your awareness back to your physical body now. <break time="3s"/>

Feel the surface beneath you. <break time="2s"/>
The weight of your body. <break time="2s"/>
The movement of your breath. <break time="3s"/>

Take a deep, refreshing breath. <break time="3s"/>

Begin to gently move your fingers and toes. <break time="3s"/>

When you're ready... let your eyes open. <break time="3s"/>

You've created a clear mental space. <break time="2s"/>
Carry this clarity with you. <break time="2s"/>

Welcome back.
</prosody>
