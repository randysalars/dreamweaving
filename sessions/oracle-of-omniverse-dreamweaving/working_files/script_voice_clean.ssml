Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
You have arrived at a threshold...<break time="2s"/>
a sacred crossing point...<break time="2s"/>
where the Oracle of the Omniverse waits to speak with you.<break time="3s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="1.5s"/>
you will journey beyond the boundaries of the known...<break time="2s"/>
into a space where all possibilities converge...<break time="2.5s"/>
where every timeline...<break time="1s"/>
every choice...<break time="1s"/>
every version of yourself across infinite realities...<break time="2s"/>
meets in perfect harmony.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/>
At any moment...<break time="1.5s"/>
you can return to full waking awareness simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/>
You are held...<break time="1.5s"/>
you are guided...<break time="1.5s"/>
and you choose, in your own time...<break time="1.5s"/>
how deeply you wish to explore.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now.<break time="2s"/>
Allow your body to be fully supported.<break time="2.5s"/>
If you are sitting...<break time="1s"/>
let your spine settle gently upright.<break time="2s"/>
If you are lying down...<break time="1s"/>
feel the surface beneath you receiving your weight.<break time="3s"/>

When you are ready...<break time="2s"/>
allow your eyes to softly close.<break time="3s"/>

And take a deep...<break time="1s"/>
nourishing breath...<break time="2s"/>
breathing in the infinite possibilities that surround you...<break time="3s"/>
and breathing out anything you no longer need to carry.<break time="4s"/>

And as you breathe...<break time="2s"/>
you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
the gentle rhythm of your own breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
rising...<break time="2s"/>
and falling...<break time="2.5s"/>
like waves on an infinite shore.<break time="3s"/>

With each inhale...<break time="2s"/>
you draw in light...<break time="2s"/>
pure...<break time="1s"/>
luminous...<break time="1s"/>
starlight from beyond the edges of reality.<break time="3s"/>

And with each exhale...<break time="2s"/>
you <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
letting go of the need to control...<break time="2s"/>
the need to understand...<break time="2s"/>
the need to be anywhere but here.<break time="4s"/>

Now I'm going to count down from ten to one...<break time="2s"/>
and with each number...<break time="1.5s"/>
you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to drift deeper...<break time="2s"/>
more relaxed...<break time="1.5s"/>
more open to what awaits you.<break time="3s"/>

Ten...<break time="1s"/>
feeling the weight of your body...<break time="1.5s"/>
heavy...<break time="1s"/>
grounded...<break time="1s"/>
completely supported.<break time="2.5s"/>

Nine...<break time="1s"/>
your shoulders softening...<break time="1.5s"/>
releasing any tension they've been holding.<break time="2.5s"/>

Eight...<break time="1s"/>
your jaw relaxing...<break time="1.5s"/>
teeth gently parting...<break time="1.5s"/>
tongue resting soft in your mouth.<break time="2.5s"/>

Seven...<break time="1s"/>
the muscles around your eyes...<break time="1.5s"/>
smoothing...<break time="1.5s"/>
letting go.<break time="2.5s"/>

Six...<break time="1s"/>
your breath deepening naturally...<break time="1.5s"/>
without effort.<break time="2.5s"/>

Five...<break time="1s"/>
halfway now...<break time="1.5s"/>
drifting deeper with each number.<break time="2.5s"/>

Four...<break time="1s"/>
your awareness turning inward...<break time="1.5s"/>
like a door quietly opening.<break time="2.5s"/>

Three...<break time="1s"/>
deeper still...<break time="1.5s"/>
settling into a space of perfect receptivity.<break time="2.5s"/>

Two...<break time="1s"/>
almost there...<break time="1.5s"/>
on the threshold of something vast.<break time="2.5s"/>

One...<break time="2s"/>

And in this deep...<break time="1.5s"/>
quiet...<break time="1.5s"/>
receptive space...<break time="2s"/>
you become aware of something shifting around you.<break time="3s"/>

The darkness behind your closed eyes...<break time="2s"/>

Stars...<break time="2s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Before you now...<break time="2s"/>
in the vastness of this starlit space...<break time="2s"/>
a temple begins to form.<break time="3s"/>

Not built of stone or wood...<break time="2s"/>
but woven from light itself...<break time="2.5s"/>
translucent...<break time="1.5s"/>
shimmering...<break time="1.5s"/>
as if spun from the fabric of possibility.<break time="3s"/>

At the center of this temple...<break time="2s"/>
you see a circular pool...<break time="2s"/>
its surface perfectly still...<break time="2s"/>
reflecting the infinite cosmos above.<break time="3s"/>

And as you approach...<break time="2s"/>
you feel your feet...<break time="1.5s"/>
here in this sacred space...<break time="2s"/>
touching smooth...<break time="1.5s"/>
cool...<break time="1.5s"/>
luminous crystal.<break time="3s"/>

You are embodied here.<break time="2s"/>
Present.<break time="2s"/>
Aware.<break time="3s"/>

And standing at the edge of this pool...<break time="2.5s"/>
you sense a presence emerging from the light.<break time="4s"/>

Three figures...<break time="2s"/>
radiant...<break time="1.5s"/>
timeless...<break time="1.5s"/>
stepping forward to greet you.<break time="3s"/>

The first...<break time="2s"/>
is the Inner Healer...<break time="2.5s"/>
cloaked in robes of soft jade and silver...<break time="2s"/>
carrying the gentle warmth of unconditional compassion.<break time="3s"/>

The Inner Healer moves toward you...<break time="2s"/>
and as this presence draws near...<break time="2s"/>
you feel a sensation...<break time="1.5s"/>
like warm honey...<break time="1.5s"/>
spreading through your chest...<break time="2s"/>
dissolving old wounds you didn't know you carried.<break time="4s"/>

The second figure...<break time="2s"/>
is the Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2.5s"/>
radiant in rose gold and amber light...<break time="2s"/>
holding a small...<break time="1.5s"/>
eternal flame in open palms.<break time="3s"/>

This flame does not burn...<break time="2s"/>
but illuminates...<break time="2s"/>
revealing the truth of who you are...<break time="2s"/>
beneath all the stories...<break time="1.5s"/>
beneath all the roles...<break time="1.5s"/>
beneath all the forgetting.<break time="4s"/>

And the third...<break time="2s"/>
is the Rose Mother...<break time="2.5s"/>
ancient...<break time="1.5s"/>
boundless...<break time="1.5s"/>
her presence woven with crimson petals and golden light...<break time="2.5s"/>
emanating a love so vast...<break time="2s"/>
it holds every universe...<break time="2s"/>
every lifetime...<break time="2s"/>
every version of you that ever was or will be.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother speaks...<break time="2s"/>
though not in words...<break time="2s"/>
but in a knowing that blooms directly in your heart.<break time="3s"/>

She shows you the pool before you.<break time="2.5s"/>
This...<break time="1.5s"/>
she whispers...<break time="1.5s"/>
is the Oracle of the Omniverse.<break time="3s"/>

Gaze into these waters...<break time="2s"/>
and you will see not one reflection...<break time="2s"/>
but infinite reflections...<break time="2.5s"/>
every choice you've made...<break time="1.5s"/>
every path you've walked...<break time="1.5s"/>
every dream you've ever dreamed.<break time="4s"/>

You kneel at the edge of the pool...<break time="2.5s"/>
and as you look into its mirror-still surface...<break time="2.5s"/>
the water begins to ripple...<break time="2s"/>
not from wind...<break time="1.5s"/>
but from the pulse of your own heart.<break time="3s"/>

And in the ripples...<break time="2s"/>
images begin to form.<break time="3s"/>

You see yourself...<break time="2s"/>
as a child...<break time="1.5s"/>
full of wonder...<break time="1.5s"/>
before the world told you who to be.<break time="3s"/>

You see yourself...<break time="2s"/>
in moments of courage...<break time="1.5s"/>
in moments of doubt...<break time="1.5s"/>
in moments of pure...<break time="1s"/>
unbounded...<break time="1s"/>
joy.<break time="3s"/>

And then the Oracle shows you something more.<break time="3s"/>

You see versions of yourself...<break time="2s"/>
in parallel timelines...<break time="2s"/>
making different choices...<break time="2s"/>
living different lives.<break time="3s"/>

In one reflection...<break time="2s"/>
you are bold...<break time="1.5s"/>
fearless...<break time="1.5s"/>
stepping into a life you once only imagined.<break time="3s"/>

In another...<break time="2s"/>
you are quiet...<break time="1.5s"/>
contemplative...<break time="1.5s"/>
finding peace in simplicity.<break time="3s"/>

And in yet another...<break time="2s"/>
you are luminous...<break time="1.5s"/>
fully expressed...<break time="1.5s"/>
radiating the gifts you were born to give.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer kneels beside you...<break time="2s"/>
and places a hand gently on your shoulder.<break time="3s"/>

All of these are you...<break time="2s"/>
the Healer whispers.<break time="2.5s"/>

Not separate...<break time="1.5s"/>
not lost...<break time="1.5s"/>
but woven into the fabric of this moment.<break time="3s"/>

You can <emphasis level="moderate">call upon</emphasis> any of these versions of yourself...<break time="2s"/>
their courage...<break time="1s"/>
their wisdom...<break time="1s"/>
their strength...<break time="1.5s"/>
whenever you need them.<break time="4s"/>

The Heart Flame Tender steps forward...<break time="2s"/>
and gently lowers the eternal flame...<break time="2s"/>
until it touches the surface of the pool.<break time="3s"/>

The water ignites...<break time="2s"/>
not with fire...<break time="1.5s"/>
but with golden light...<break time="2s"/>
and the reflections merge...<break time="2s"/>
spiraling together into a single...<break time="1.5s"/>
radiant...<break time="1.5s"/>
unified presence.<break time="3s"/>

You.<break time="3s"/>

Whole.<break time="2s"/>
Complete.<break time="2s"/>
Infinite.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother opens her arms...<break time="2s"/>
and the pool begins to rise...<break time="2s"/>
becoming a fountain of light...<break time="2s"/>
cascading upward and outward...<break time="2s"/>
showering you in liquid starlight.<break time="3s"/>

You feel it on your skin...<break time="2s"/>
cool...<break time="1s"/>
electric...<break time="1s"/>
alive.<break time="2.5s"/>

You taste it on your lips...<break time="2s"/>
sweet...<break time="1s"/>
like honeyed nectar and midnight rain.<break time="3s"/>

You breathe it into your lungs...<break time="2s"/>
and it fills you with a knowing...<break time="2.5s"/>
a remembering...<break time="2s"/>
that you are not small...<break time="2s"/>
not limited...<break time="2s"/>
not separate from the Source of all things.<break time="4s"/>

The Oracle has spoken.<break time="3s"/>

Not in prophecy...<break time="2s"/>
but in revelation.<break time="3s"/>

You are the dreamer...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the dream.<break time="2s"/>

You are the question...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the answer.<break time="2s"/>

You are held in infinite love...<break time="2s"/>
across infinite realities...<break time="2s"/>
and you have always been enough.<break time="5s"/>

This is yours to keep...<break time="2s"/>
