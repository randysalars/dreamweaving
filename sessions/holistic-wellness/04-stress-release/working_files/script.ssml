Welcome to Stress Release Protocol. <break time="1.5s"/>

Stress accumulates in the body like sediment in a river. <break time="2s"/>
Over time... what was once flowing freely becomes blocked and stagnant. <break time="2s"/>

This session is designed to flush out accumulated stress... returning your nervous system to its natural state of ease. <break time="2s"/>

Find a comfortable position. <break time="1.5s"/>
Close your eyes. <break time="1.5s"/>

It's time to let go.
</prosody>
<break time="3s"/>

<!-- INITIAL RELEASE (2 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Take a deep breath in... <break time="3s"/>
And as you exhale... let out a sigh... releasing stress with your breath. <break time="4s"/>

Another breath in... <break time="3s"/>
And sigh it out... letting go even more. <break time="4s"/>

One more... breathe in... <break time="3s"/>
And release everything... with a full exhale. <break time="4s"/>

Good. <break time="2s"/>
Already... your body is beginning to let go.
</prosody>
<break time="3s"/>

<!-- PROGRESSIVE TENSION RELEASE (9 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
We're going to move through your body... deliberately tensing and then releasing each area. <break time="3s"/>

This technique... called progressive muscle relaxation... teaches your body the difference between tension and relaxation. <break time="3s"/>

Start with your feet. <break time="2s"/>
Curl your toes tightly... squeeze the muscles in your feet... <break time="3s"/>
Hold this tension... <break time="3s"/>
And release. <break time="2s"/>
Feel the contrast. <break time="2s"/>
Feel the release. <break time="4s"/>

Now your calves. <break time="2s"/>
Tense your lower legs... flex your feet upward... <break time="3s"/>
Hold... <break time="3s"/>
And release. <break time="3s"/>
The tension drains away. <break time="4s"/>

Your thighs. <break time="2s"/>
Press your legs together... tense your upper legs... <break time="3s"/>
Hold tightly... <break time="3s"/>
And release. <break time="3s"/>
Softness spreading. <break time="4s"/>

Your buttocks and hips. <break time="2s"/>
Squeeze and clench... <break time="3s"/>
Hold... <break time="3s"/>
And release. <break time="3s"/>
Feel the letting go. <break time="4s"/>

Your stomach. <break time="2s"/>
Tighten your abdominal muscles... draw them in... <break time="3s"/>
Hold... <break time="3s"/>
And release. <break time="3s"/>
Completely soft now. <break time="4s"/>

Your chest. <break time="2s"/>
Take a deep breath and hold it... feeling the tension... <break time="4s"/>
And exhale... releasing. <break time="4s"/>

Your hands. <break time="2s"/>
Make tight fists... squeeze hard... <break time="3s"/>
Hold... <break time="3s"/>
And release... fingers spreading open. <break time="4s"/>

Your arms. <break time="2s"/>
Bend your elbows and tense your biceps... <break time="3s"/>
Hold... <break time="3s"/>
And release. <break time="3s"/>
Heavy and relaxed. <break time="4s"/>

Your shoulders. <break time="2s"/>
Raise them up toward your ears... <break time="3s"/>
Hold the tension... <break time="3s"/>
And let them drop. <break time="3s"/>
All the stress of the world... sliding off. <break time="4s"/>

Your face. <break time="2s"/>
Scrunch your whole face tightly... eyes, nose, mouth... <break time="3s"/>
Hold... <break time="3s"/>
And release... smoothing out. <break time="4s"/>

Your whole body is now deeply relaxed. <break time="3s"/>

Any remaining stress... imagine it as a dark mist... rising up from your body... and dissipating into the air. <break time="5s"/>

Gone. <break time="3s"/>

You are clear. <break time="2s"/>
You are calm. <break time="2s"/>
You are at peace.
</prosody>
<break time="5s"/>

<!-- CLOSING (2 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Take a deep, refreshing breath now. <break time="3s"/>

Notice how different your body feels. <break time="2s"/>
Lighter. <break time="2s"/>
Clearer. <break time="2s"/>
More spacious. <break time="3s"/>

This is your natural state. <break time="2s"/>
Stress is the visitor... not your home. <break time="3s"/>

Begin to bring gentle movement back. <break time="2s"/>
Wiggle your fingers and toes. <break time="2s"/>
Stretch if you like. <break time="3s"/>

When you're ready... open your eyes. <break time="3s"/>

Go forward with ease. <break time="2s"/>

Welcome back.
