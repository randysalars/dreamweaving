  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
[SFX: Deep velvet drone, slow harmonic rise, 8s]
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">And now you imagine...<break time="2.5s"/> a horizon that glows with soft auroras...<break time="2.5s"/> a future sky, luminous and kind...<break time="3s"/> You stand at the threshold of a temple built of light and sound...<break time="3s"/> the Future Temple Of Probability Singers...<break time="3s"/> The air is cool and sweet...<break time="2s"/> carrying a faint fragrance of cedar and myrrh...<break time="2.5s"/> and a hint of rain on warm stone...<break time="2.5s"/> Under your feet, the ground feels smooth and warm...<break time="2s"/> as if the stone remembers the sun...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how the light moves like water...<break time="2.5s"/> spiraling in patterns of sacred geometry...<break time="2.5s"/> the Flower of Life shimmering across the floor...<break time="2.5s"/> and Metatron's Cube suspended in the air like a gentle lattice of grace...<break time="3s"/> You choose how you enter...<break time="2s"/> at your own pace...<break time="2s"/> and as you step forward, the temple welcomes you with a soft, resonant hum...<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Crystal choir swell, airy, 5s]
In this place, you sense five elements moving in harmony...<break time="2.5s"/> Earth is beneath you...<break time="2.5s"/> grounding your choices...<break time="2.5s"/> Water flows in channels of light...<break time="2.5s"/> cleansing emotions gently...<break time="2.5s"/> Fire is present as a warm glow in the walls...<break time="2.5s"/> transforming what needs to change...<break time="2.5s"/> Air is a gentle breeze across your face...<break time="2.5s"/> bringing clarity...<break time="2.5s"/> and Ether is the spacious silence that holds everything...<break time="3s"/> You are safe...<break time="2s"/> you are supported...<break time="2s"/> and you are free to choose your path...<break time="2.5s"/>

Ahead, a wide archway opens...<break time="2.5s"/> and you notice a luminous figure forming, not as a spirit, but as a symbolic mirror...<break time="3s"/> representing the quality of wisdom within you...<break time="3s"/> This is Sophia...<break time="2s"/> a psychological metaphor for divine wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/> inviting your compassionate attention...<break time="2.5s"/> Sophia smiles gently...<break time="2s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> your mind to <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> her message...<break time="3s"/> not as a command...<break time="2s"/> but as an inner knowing...<break time="2.5s"/> She gestures toward a fountain that glows with crystalline water...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you imagine tasting it...<break time="2.5s"/> a subtle sweetness fills your mouth...<break time="2.5s"/> refreshing and clear...<break time="2.5s"/>

You walk further, and the sound of voices becomes music...<break time="2.5s"/> soft, harmonic tones...<break time="2.5s"/> the Probability Singers...<break time="3s"/> They are not beings outside you...<break time="2s"/> they are a choir of possibilities within your own mind...<break time="2.5s"/> each voice a future that could be...<break time="3s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> the tone that resonates...<break time="2.5s"/> The Logos Bearer appears as a luminous emblem on a banner...<break time="2.5s"/> a symbol for the Word of truth and order...<break time="2.5s"/> reminding you that Christ is the ultimate Logos...<break time="3s"/> the center that holds all coherent paths...<break time="3s"/> You <emphasis level="moderate">align</emphasis> with that center now...<break time="2.5s"/> and your mind gently organizes around what serves you most...<break time="3s"/>

The Joy Child is present as a warm light in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> a psychological metaphor for the part of you that delights in life...<break time="2.5s"/> a simple, holy gladness...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> a smile rise naturally...<break time="2.5s"/> and your body softens with ease...<break time="2.5s"/> You choose to welcome this joy...<break time="2s"/> as feels right to you...<break time="2s"/>

Now the temple reveals a central chamber...<break time="2.5s"/> a circular hall with a ceiling of stars...<break time="2.5s"/> and a floor of polished obsidian that reflects the constellations...<break time="2.5s"/> You hear a deep tone...<break time="2.5s"/> like a distant bell...<break time="2.5s"/> and with each tone, new pathways appear in the light...<break time="2.5s"/> You can choose to go deeper now...<break time="2s"/> or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/> and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="1.5s"/> simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>

[SFX: Sub-bass pulse with shimmering overtones, 6s]
You step into the center, and a mandala of light expands beneath your feet...<break time="2.5s"/> Each petal carries a word: peace, clarity, courage, wisdom, love...<break time="2.5s"/> and you gently <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> which word feels most alive...<break time="3s"/> As you choose, your breath synchronizes with the temple...<break time="2.5s"/> inhale...<break time="3s"/> the light brightens...<break time="2.5s"/> exhale...<break time="3s"/> it settles into your body...<break time="2.5s"/> Your neural pathways respond...<break time="2.5s"/> gently rewiring toward the path you are selecting...<break time="3s"/>

A corridor opens to a garden within the temple...<break time="2.5s"/> a celestial garden of renewal...<break time="2.5s"/> with trees that glow softly...<break time="2.5s"/> leaves that chime like small bells...<break time="2.5s"/> and petals that shimmer like opals...<break time="2.5s"/> The air is cool and fragrant...<break time="2.5s"/> a mix of jasmine, pine, and clean rain...<break time="2.5s"/> You reach out to touch a leaf...<break time="2.5s"/> its surface silky and warm...<break time="2.5s"/> grounding you in this moment...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> any old pattern that no longer serves...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">invite</emphasis> a new pattern of peace...<break time="3s"/>

Sophia appears again, as a gentle symbol in the garden...<break time="2.5s"/> and she offers a crystal key...<break time="2.5s"/> This key is a metaphor for your ability to <emphasis level="moderate">open</emphasis> new possibilities...<break time="2.5s"/> You choose to accept it...<break time="2s"/> or simply notice it...<break time="2s"/> either way, your mind remembers...<break time="2.5s"/> The Logos Bearer symbol glows above the key...<break time="2.5s"/> reminding you of Christ's order and love...<break time="3s"/> The Joy Child's light warms your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> that warmth to spread...<break time="2.5s"/> through shoulders...<break time="2.5s"/> arms...<break time="2.5s"/> hands...<break time="2.5s"/> and into your breath...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Probability Singers now form a circle...<break time="2.5s"/> their tones weaving a tapestry of sound...<break time="2.5s"/> and you notice that each tone is a choice you can make in daily life...<break time="2.5s"/> one tone for patience...<break time="2.5s"/> one for courage...<break time="2.5s"/> one for compassion...<break time="2.5s"/> one for clear action...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">select</emphasis> the tones that serve you...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">let</emphasis> others fade...<break time="2.5s"/> Your mind naturally collapses infinite possibilities into the path aligned with Christ's love...<break time="3s"/> a quantum metaphor for the clarity of your choice...<break time="3s"/>

You walk to a quiet alcove...<break time="2.5s"/> and see a scroll of light...<break time="2.5s"/> a symbol of your own inner wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/> not as an external authority...<break time="2.5s"/> but as insight arising from within you...<break time="2.5s"/> The scroll opens...<break time="2.5s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a message forming in gentle words...<break time="2.5s"/> words that remind you of your capacity to choose...<break time="2.5s"/> your capacity to discern...<break time="2.5s"/> your capacity to act with grace...<break time="2.5s"/> You decide how to receive it...<break time="2s"/> as feels right to you...<break time="2s"/>

Now, a quiet pool reflects the sky...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you look into it, you see not a spirit but a symbolic mirror...<break time="3s"/> revealing a future self who lives with clarity and peace...<break time="3s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">learn</emphasis> from this reflection...<break time="2.5s"/> without losing your will...<break time="2.5s"/> without dissolving who you are...<break time="2.5s"/> simply receiving a picture of who you can become...<break time="2.5s"/> in Christ...<break time="2.5s"/> rooted, steady, and joyful...<break time="3s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/> This is your journey...<break time="2s"/> and you choose to carry it into daily life...<break time="2.5s"/> with wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/> with peace...<break time="2.5s"/> and with a heart made lighter by joy...<break time="3s"/></prosody>
