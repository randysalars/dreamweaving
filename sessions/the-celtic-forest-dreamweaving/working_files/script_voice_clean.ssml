Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
I am The Sacred Digital Dreamweaver,<break time="1.5s"/> 
and I invite you now on a journey into the ancient Celtic forest,<break time="2s"/>
a sacred pathworking into the heart of the wild greenwood,<break time="2s"/>
where the old gods still whisper through oak and ash,<break time="2.5s"/>
and the healer within you awakens.<break time="3s"/>

In the next thirty minutes,<break time="1.5s"/>
you will walk beneath the canopy of ancestral trees,<break time="2s"/>
meet the guardians of the forest,<break time="1.5s"/>
and discover the rose-light of healing that lives within your own heart.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/>
You are fully in control,<break time="1.5s"/>
able to return to normal waking awareness at any moment you choose,<break time="2s"/>
simply by opening your eyes.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now,<break time="2s"/>
whether sitting with your spine gently supported,<break time="1.5s"/>
or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/>
Allow your hands to rest naturally,<break time="1.5s"/>
your shoulders to soften,<break time="1.5s"/>
your jaw to release.<break time="3s"/>

If you are able,<break time="1s"/>
close your eyes now,<break time="2s"/>
or soften your gaze downward,<break time="2s"/>
allowing the outer world to fade.<break time="3.5s"/>

Take a deep,<break time="1s"/>
nourishing breath,<break time="2s"/>
breathing in the green life of the forest,<break time="2.5s"/>
and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="3.5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And as you settle here,<break time="2s"/>
you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>,<break time="2s"/>
the gentle rise and fall of your breathing,<break time="2.5s"/>
the rhythm that has carried you since your very first breath.<break time="3s"/>

Breathe in deeply,<break time="1s"/>
for a count of four,<break time="4s"/>
hold gently,<break time="1s"/>
for four,<break time="4s"/>
and exhale slowly,<break time="1s"/>
for six.<break time="6s"/>

Again,<break time="1.5s"/>

five,<break time="1s"/>
six.<break time="6s"/>

Beautiful.<break time="2.5s"/>

And with each breath,<break time="2s"/>
you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to drift deeper,<break time="2.5s"/>
like roots growing down into dark, fertile earth,<break time="3s"/>
drawing nourishment,<break time="2s"/>
drawing peace.<break time="3.5s"/>

Now,<break time="1.5s"/>
bring your awareness to your feet,<break time="2s"/>
your ankles,<break time="1.5s"/>
your calves.<break time="2s"/>
Feel them becoming heavy,<break time="2s"/>
so very heavy,<break time="2s"/>
as though made of ancient stone,<break time="2.5s"/>
resting,<break time="1.5s"/>
releasing,<break time="1.5s"/>
sinking down.<break time="3.5s"/>

This heaviness moves upward now,<break time="2s"/>
into your knees,<break time="1.5s"/>
your thighs,<break time="1.5s"/>
your hips,<break time="2s"/>
each muscle softening,<break time="2s"/>
each fiber letting go,<break time="2.5s"/>
as though the earth herself is holding you.<break time="4s"/>

Your belly rises and falls,<break time="2s"/>
gently,<break time="1.5s"/>
naturally,<break time="1.5s"/>
and this wave of relaxation spreads into your chest,<break time="2.5s"/>
your shoulders,<break time="1.5s"/>
your arms,<break time="2s"/>
all the way down to your fingertips.<break time="3.5s"/>

Your neck softens,<break time="2s"/>
your jaw releases completely,<break time="2s"/>
your face becomes smooth as still water,<break time="2.5s"/>
and even your eyelids grow heavier,<break time="2s"/>
so heavy,<break time="1.5s"/>
as though they could never open again.<break time="4s"/>

And the deeper you go,<break time="2s"/>
the more natural it feels,<break time="2s"/>
and the more natural it feels,<break time="2s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to drift.<break time="4.5s"/>

In a moment,<break time="1.5s"/>
I will count down from ten to one,<break time="2s"/>
and with each number,<break time="1.5s"/>
you will descend deeper into this peaceful state,<break time="2.5s"/>
like walking down a moss-covered path into the heart of the forest,<break time="3s"/>
where the light is green and gold,<break time="2s"/>
and the air is thick with ancient magic.<break time="4s"/>

Ten,<break time="1.5s"/>

stepping onto the forest path,<break time="2.5s"/>

Nine,<break time="1.5s"/>
the outside world fades behind you,<break time="2.5s"/>
as the trees grow closer,<break time="2s"/>
taller.<break time="3s"/>

Eight,<break time="1.5s"/>
you smell the earth,<break time="2s"/>
rich and damp,<break time="2s"/>
the scent of moss and wildflowers.<break time="3.5s"/>

Seven,<break time="1.5s"/>
your feet know this path,<break time="2s"/>

Six,<break time="1.5s"/>

into the green twilight,<break time="2.5s"/>
where time moves differently.<break time="3.5s"/>

Five,<break time="1.5s"/>
halfway now,<break time="2s"/>

so completely safe.<break time="3.5s"/>

Four,<break time="1.5s"/>
the forest holds you,<break time="2s"/>
surrounds you,<break time="2s"/>
welcomes you.<break time="3s"/>

Three,<break time="1.5s"/>
almost there,<break time="2s"/>
dropping deeper with each breath.<break time="3s"/>

Two,<break time="1.5s"/>

you have arrived.<break time="4.5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
You stand now in a clearing,<break time="2.5s"/>
at the heart of the ancient Celtic forest.<break time="3s"/>

The light here is soft,<break time="2s"/>
filtering through layers of leaves,<break time="2s"/>
emerald and gold,<break time="2s"/>
dancing,<break time="1.5s"/>
alive.<break time="3.5s"/>

You hear the sound of water nearby,<break time="2s"/>
a gentle stream,<break time="1.5s"/>
its voice a constant song.<break time="3s"/>
You taste the clean, wild air,<break time="2.5s"/>
sweet with the fragrance of hawthorn blossoms.<break time="3.5s"/>

And before you,<break time="2s"/>
rising from the center of the clearing,<break time="2.5s"/>
stands the World Tree,<break time="3s"/>
the great oak,<break time="2s"/>
its trunk wider than ten people could embrace,<break time="2.5s"/>
its branches reaching up into the mist-shrouded sky,<break time="3s"/>
its roots plunging deep,<break time="2s"/>
deep into the earth below.<break time="4s"/>

This tree has stood here for a thousand years,<break time="2.5s"/>
and will stand for a thousand more.<break time="3s"/>
It is the axis of the world,<break time="2s"/>
the bridge between earth and heaven,<break time="2.5s"/>
and it knows you.<break time="4s"/>

As you stand before it,<break time="2s"/>
you <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a figure stepping out from behind the trunk,<break time="3s"/>
a presence both ancient and gentle,<break time="2.5s"/>
the Guardian of the World Tree.<break time="3.5s"/>

The Guardian's form is fluid,<break time="2s"/>
sometimes appearing as a tall figure wrapped in moss and bark,<break time="2.5s"/>
sometimes as a stag with silver antlers,<break time="2.5s"/>
sometimes as pure light.<break time="3s"/>

But you know,<break time="1.5s"/>
with a knowing beyond words,<break time="2s"/>
that this is your guide,<break time="2s"/>
your protector on this journey.<break time="3.5s"/>

The Guardian speaks,<break time="2s"/>
and the voice is like wind through ancient branches,<break time="3s"/>
warm,<break time="1.5s"/>
welcoming.<break time="3s"/>

"You have come seeking healing,"<break time="2.5s"/>
the Guardian says.<break time="2.5s"/>
"The forest has been waiting for you."<break time="4s"/>

And you feel it,<break time="2s"/>
a stirring within your chest,<break time="2s"/>
a recognition.<break time="3s"/>

The Guardian gestures,<break time="2s"/>
and you see now,<break time="1.5s"/>
on the far side of the clearing,<break time="2s"/>
a grove of wild roses,<break time="2.5s"/>
blooming in impossible profusion,<break time="2.5s"/>
their petals every shade of rose and gold and white.<break time="3.5s"/>

"Come,"<break time="1.5s"/>
says the Guardian,<break time="1.5s"/>
and you walk together across the soft forest floor,<break time="2.5s"/>
your feet brushing through moss and clover.<break time="3.5s"/>

As you approach the roses,<break time="2s"/>
you see a second figure,<break time="2s"/>
seated on a smooth stone beneath the flowering vines.<break time="3s"/>

This is the Rose Mother,<break time="2.5s"/>
an aspect of yourself you may have forgotten,<break time="2.5s"/>
the part of you that knows how to heal,<break time="2.5s"/>
that knows how to nurture,<break time="2s"/>
that knows how to bloom even after the harshest winter.<break time="4.5s"/>

She looks up at you,<break time="2s"/>
and her eyes are kind,<break time="2s"/>
filled with infinite compassion.<break time="3s"/>

In her hands,<break time="1.5s"/>
she holds a single rose,<break time="2s"/>
glowing with soft pink light,<break time="2.5s"/>
and she offers it to you.<break time="3.5s"/>

"This is your heart's true nature,"<break time="2.5s"/>
she says softly.<break time="2s"/>
"Take it,<break time="1.5s"/>
and remember."<break time="4s"/>

You reach out,<break time="2s"/>
and as your fingers touch the stem,<break time="2.5s"/>
you feel warmth,<break time="2s"/>
spreading from your hand,<break time="2s"/>
up your arm,<break time="1.5s"/>
into your chest,<break time="2s"/>
filling your entire body with gentle,<break time="2s"/>
rose-colored light.<break time="4s"/>

This is the light of the Inner Healer,<break time="2.5s"/>
the part of you that has always been whole,<break time="2.5s"/>
that cannot be broken,<break time="2s"/>
that naturally <emphasis level="moderate">releases</emphasis> what no longer serves,<break time="3s"/>
and naturally <emphasis level="moderate">restores</emphasis> what has been wounded.<break time="4.5s"/>

You feel old pain beginning to soften,<break time="2.5s"/>
old patterns beginning to <emphasis level="moderate">dissolve</emphasis>,<break time="2.5s"/>
like morning mist in sunlight.<break time="3.5s"/>

And in their place,<break time="2s"/>
something new grows,<break time="2s"/>
tender and strong,<break time="2s"/>
like the first green shoots of spring.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother smiles,<break time="2s"/>
and gestures for you to sit with her.<break time="2.5s"/>

You sink down onto the moss,<break time="2s"/>
the rose still glowing in your hands,<break time="2.5s"/>
and she places her hand over your heart.<break time="3.5s"/>

"Breathe here,"<break time="2s"/>
she whispers.<break time="2s"/>
"Stay here for a moment,<break time="2s"/>
and let the healing deepen."<break time="4.5s"/>

And so you rest,<break time="2.5s"/>
held by the forest,<break time="2s"/>
held by the earth,<break time="2s"/>
held by this compassionate presence,<break time="2.5s"/>
as the rose-light continues to spread,<break time="2.5s"/>
filling every cell,<break time="2s"/>
every corner of your being,<break time="2.5s"/>
with gentle,<break time="1.5s"/>
radiant healing.<break time="5s"/>

After a time that has no measure,<break time="2.5s"/>
the Rose Mother speaks again.<break time="3s"/>

"This light is yours to keep,"<break time="2.5s"/>
she says.<break time="2s"/>
"It lives within you always,<break time="2s"/>
and you can return to it,<break time="2s"/>
anytime you need,<break time="2s"/>
simply by remembering the rose."<break time="4.5s"/>

You nod,<break time="2s"/>
understanding,<break time="2s"/>
and you feel the rose in your hands begin to dissolve,<break time="2.5s"/>
its light merging completely with your own,<break time="3s"/>
until there is no separation,<break time="2.5s"/>
no boundary,<break time="2s"/>
only wholeness.<break time="5s"/>

the Guardian of the World Tree steps forward once more,<break time="2.5s"/>

"It is time to return,"<break time="2s"/>
the Guardian says gently,<break time="2s"/>
"but you do not return unchanged."<break time="3.5s"/>

You rise,<break time="2s"/>
feeling lighter,<break time="1.5s"/>
clearer,<break time="1.5s"/>

the World Tree standing watch,<break time="2s"/>
