### 01 Pretalk — Threshold
```
starry twilight horizon with a faint colossal silhouette of a geometric starship,
soft omnidirectional glow under the hull, cinematic, mysterious, gentle welcome
```

### 02 Induction — Approach to Atlas
```
colossal geometric starship hovering above a quiet alien sea, angles defying Euclidean space,
hull etched with scrolling glyphs of light, soft plasma hatch shimmering, solemn and inviting
```

### 03 Journey Outer — Boarding
```
plasma corridor opening into a starship, floating glyphs forming a bridge,
walls breathing with bioluminescent pulses synced to a heartbeat, deep perspective, sci-fi sacred
```

### 04 Corridor Glyphs — Telepathic Architecture
```
interior of a living vessel, bioluminescent glyphs drifting in air,
transparent floor over swirling nebula abyss, serene and awe-filled, sacred technology aesthetic
```

### 05 Helm Attunement — Spherical Chamber
```
helm of observation, spherical chamber of liquid light rotating around a silent core,
observer standing in center, consciousness-linked interface, luminous, fractal, serene
```

### 06 Gift Download — Navigational Attunement
```
light lattice descending into a human silhouette, fractal multivalent patterns,
telepathic data stream, warm silver-blue light, sense of ancient future intelligence
```

### 07 Return — Cosmic Dawn
```
exiting the starship to a dawn sky, golden light over starlit terrain,
ship receding into higher dimensions as a glowing polyhedron, peaceful closure
```
