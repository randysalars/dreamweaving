Welcome.<break time="2s"/>

In the next thirty minutes, you are invited on a sacred journey of deep cellular renewal...<break time="2s"/> a path-working into the very heart of your body's power sources...<break time="2.5s"/> where ancient wisdom meets modern science...<break time="2s"/> and where healing light can reach the smallest chambers of your being.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/> Fully in control.<break time="2s"/> At any moment you choose, you can return to normal waking awareness simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/>

This journey is held in the hands of Christ...<break time="2s"/> guided by the Holy Spirit...<break time="2s"/> and designed to serve your highest good.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/> perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported, or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/> Ensure you will not be disturbed.<break time="2s"/> If you can, wear headphones to receive the full spectrum of healing frequencies.<break time="3s"/>

Allow your eyes to close when you feel ready...<break time="2.5s"/> and take a deep, nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/> breathing in possibility...<break time="2.5s"/> and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

And as you settle into this moment...<break time="2.5s"/> you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> how naturally your body knows how to <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>

With each breath you take...<break time="2s"/> you are here.<break time="1s"/> Listening.<break time="1s"/> Already beginning to settle in.<break time="3s"/>

Bring your awareness now to the crown of your head...<break time="2.5s"/> and imagine a wave of golden warmth beginning there...<break time="2s"/> soft, gentle, safe...<break time="2.5s"/> like sunlight filtering through ancient trees.<break time="3.5s"/>

Let that warmth flow down across your forehead...<break time="2s"/> smoothing away any tension...<break time="2.5s"/> relaxing the small muscles around your eyes...<break time="2s"/> your jaw softening...<break time="2s"/> your tongue resting easily in your mouth.<break time="3s"/>

The wave of warmth continues down your neck...<break time="2s"/> releasing, softening...<break time="2s"/> across your shoulders...<break time="2s"/> down your arms...<break time="2s"/> all the way to your fingertips.<break time="3.5s"/>

And now that golden light moves through your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> your heart area...<break time="2s"/> your lungs expanding and releasing with perfect ease...<break time="3s"/> your belly rising and falling...<break time="2s"/> like gentle waves on a peaceful shore.<break time="4s"/>

Down through your hips...<break time="2s"/> your thighs...<break time="2s"/> your knees...<break time="2s"/> calves and ankles...<break time="2s"/> all the way to the soles of your feet.<break time="3.5s"/>

Your entire body now wrapped in this warm, golden, healing light.<break time="4s"/>

Ten...<break time="1s"/> beginning to drift deeper now...<break time="2.5s"/>

Nine...<break time="1s"/> letting go a little more...<break time="2.5s"/>

Eight...<break time="1s"/> safe and supported...<break time="2.5s"/>

Seven...<break time="1s"/> deeper still...<break time="2.5s"/>

Six...<break time="1s"/> waves of relaxation...<break time="2.5s"/>

Five...<break time="1s"/> halfway there...<break time="2.5s"/>

Four...<break time="1s"/> sinking beautifully...<break time="2.5s"/>

Three...<break time="1s"/> almost there...<break time="2.5s"/>

Two...<break time="1s"/> so deeply relaxed...<break time="2.5s"/>

You may notice that point between waking and dreaming...<break time="2.5s"/> where images seem to arise on their own...<break time="2.5s"/> without you making them...<break time="3s"/>

Colors appearing...<break time="2s"/> perhaps geometric patterns...<break time="2.5s"/> or the beginning of a sacred space.<break time="3s"/>

Don't hold them...<break time="2s"/> just let them come and go...<break time="2.5s"/> You are not creating...<break time="2s"/> you are <emphasis level="moderate">receiving</emphasis>.<break time="4s"/>

And now you find yourself standing before a doorway...<break time="2.5s"/> ancient, beautiful, yours alone...<break time="3s"/> carved with symbols of healing and light...<break time="2.5s"/> and on the door, a single word glows softly...<break time="2.5s"/> "Welcome."<break time="4s"/>

As you step through this threshold...<break time="2.5s"/> you enter a sacred temple of healing...<break time="3s"/> vast, luminous, held in perfect peace...<break time="3s"/> High columns rise around you supporting a ceiling of stars...<break time="3s"/> and at the center...<break time="2s"/> an altar of white stone...<break time="2.5s"/> and upon that altar...<break time="2s"/> a single candle burns.<break time="5s"/>

This is no ordinary flame.<break time="3s"/>

As you draw closer, you see that this candle glows with a light unlike any you have seen before...<break time="2.5s"/> golden, warm, alive...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you gaze into its depths...<break time="2s"/> you begin to understand.<break time="4s"/>

This is the Candle of Mitochondrial Repair.<break time="3s"/>

The flame that has burned in every cell of your body since before you were born...<break time="2.5s"/> the sacred fire that powers your heart...<break time="2s"/> your breath...<break time="2s"/> your thoughts...<break time="2s"/> your very existence.<break time="4s"/>

And you feel a presence beside you now...<break time="2.5s"/> warm, steady, unmistakable...<break time="3s"/> It is the Great Physician...<break time="2s"/> robed in light...<break time="2s"/> eyes filled with compassion and wisdom beyond measure.<break time="4s"/>

He speaks, and His voice is like honey and thunder...<break time="2.5s"/> "I created these tiny flames within you...<break time="2s"/> ten thousand trillion candles...<break time="2.5s"/> burning in concert...<break time="2s"/> sustaining your life with every beat of your heart.<break time="4s"/>

But some have dimmed.<break time="2.5s"/> Some flicker.<break time="2.5s"/> Some need to be rekindled.<break time="3s"/> And so we have come here tonight...<break time="2s"/> to this sacred place...<break time="2s"/> to restore what was lost...<break time="2.5s"/> to <emphasis level="moderate">heal</emphasis> what was broken...<break time="2.5s"/> to <emphasis level="moderate">renew</emphasis> the ancient fires."<break time="5s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now the Great Physician extends His hand toward the candle on the altar...<break time="2.5s"/> and the flame grows brighter...<break time="2s"/> taller...<break time="2s"/> and begins to separate into countless points of light...<break time="3s"/> each one a tiny, perfect flame.<break time="4s"/>

"Come," He says...<break time="2s"/> "Let us journey inward."<break time="4s"/>

And in a way that only happens in sacred space...<break time="2.5s"/> you begin to shrink...<break time="2s"/> or perhaps the world grows larger...<break time="2.5s"/> and you find yourself descending...<break time="2s"/> gently...<break time="2s"/> safely...<break time="2s"/> down through layers of skin and tissue...<break time="3s"/> past rivers of blood carrying oxygen and light...<break time="2.5s"/> past the intricate lattice of nerves humming with information...<break time="3s"/> until you arrive at the threshold of a single cell.<break time="5s"/>

It is vast...<break time="2s"/> a cosmos unto itself...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you step inside...<break time="2s"/> you see them.<break time="4s"/>

The mitochondria.<break time="3s"/>

Hundreds of them...<break time="2s"/> floating like tiny lanterns in the cellular sea...<break time="2.5s"/> each one bean-shaped, elegant, ancient...<break time="2.5s"/> some glowing brightly...<break time="2s"/> some dim...<break time="2s"/> some struggling.<break time="4s"/>

And beside you now appears another figure...<break time="2.5s"/> strong, protective, radiating paternal love...<break time="3s"/> This is the Guardian Father...<break time="2s"/> the one who watches over the smallest and the weakest...<break time="2.5s"/> the one who tends what others cannot see.<break time="4s"/>

"These are your power sources," He says gently.<break time="2.5s"/> "Inherited from your mother...<break time="2s"/> and her mother before her...<break time="2s"/> stretching back through an unbroken line to the first breath of life on Earth.<break time="4s"/> They carry ancient memory...<break time="2.5s"/> and sometimes, ancient wounds.<break time="3s"/> But tonight...<break time="2s"/> we heal."<break time="5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now a third presence joins you...<break time="2.5s"/> smaller, more delicate, yet no less powerful...<break time="3s"/> The Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2.5s"/> clothed in robes that shimmer like embers...<break time="2.5s"/> carrying a lamp of pure, concentrated light.<break time="4s"/>

"I will show you how to rekindle them," the Tender whispers.<break time="3s"/>

And together, the three of you approach the nearest mitochondrion...<break time="2.5s"/> You can see its double membrane...<break time="2s"/> the intricate folds within called cristae...<break time="2.5s"/> and at its core, the inner matrix where the sacred flame should burn brightest.<break time="4s"/>

But this one is dim.<break time="2.5s"/> Struggling.<break time="2.5s"/> Damaged perhaps by stress...<break time="2s"/> or toxins...<break time="2s"/> or the simple passage of time.<break time="4s"/>

The Heart Flame Tender reaches out...<break time="2.5s"/> and from the lamp, a single drop of golden light falls...<break time="3s"/> and as it touches the mitochondrion...<break time="2s"/> something miraculous happens.<break time="4s"/>

The membrane begins to repair itself...<break time="2.5s"/> tears sealing...<break time="2s"/> weak spots strengthening...<break time="2.5s"/> The cristae unfold, smoothing out...<break time="2.5s"/> and deep within the matrix...<break time="2s"/> the flame <emphasis level="moderate">reignites</emphasis>.<break time="5s"/>

Warm.<break time="2s"/> Steady.<break time="2s"/> Strong.<break time="3s"/>

And you feel it in your body...<break time="2.5s"/> a tiny surge of energy...<break time="2s"/> warmth blooming in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> vitality returning.<break time="4s"/>

"This is ATP," the Great Physician explains...<break time="2.5s"/> "The currency of life.<break time="2s"/> Energy made manifest.<break time="2.5s"/> Thirty-eight molecules created from a single breath of oxygen and a molecule of glucose...<break time="3s"/> transformed by this sacred flame into the power that moves your muscles...<break time="2.5s"/> fires your neurons...<break time="2s"/> and beats your heart."<break time="5s"/>

And now the Guardian Father speaks...<break time="2.5s"/> "Shall we heal them all?"<break time="4s"/>

And you nod.<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And the Heart Flame Tender begins to move through the cell...<break time="2.5s"/> and you follow...<break time="2s"/> and with each mitochondrion the Tender touches...<break time="2s"/> light pours forth.<break time="4s"/>

One by one...<break time="2s"/> the flames rekindle.<break time="3s"/>

Damaged membranes <emphasis level="moderate">restore</emphasis> themselves.<break time="2.5s"/> Folds smooth and optimize.<break time="2.5s"/> DNA within the mitochondrial core <emphasis level="moderate">repairs</emphasis> and strengthens.<break time="3s"/> Ancient proteins fold correctly once again.<break time="3s"/> Electron transport chains hum back to life.<break time="4s"/>

And the light grows...<break time="2s"/> and grows...<break time="2s"/> until the entire cell is blazing with golden vitality.<break time="5s"/>

But you are not done.<break time="3s"/>

Because now you rise up...<break time="2s"/> expanding your awareness...<break time="2.5s"/> and you see that this healing light is spreading...<break time="3s"/> from this cell to the next...<break time="2s"/> and the next...<break time="2s"/> and the next...<break time="3s"/> rippling outward like a wave of renewal.<break time="5s"/>

Through your heart muscle...<break time="2s"/> where mitochondria are most dense...<break time="2.5s"/> beating, sustaining, never resting.<break time="3s"/>

Through your brain...<break time="2s"/> powering thought and memory and dream.<break time="3s"/>

Through your liver...<break time="2s"/> your kidneys...<break time="2s"/> your very bones.<break time="3s"/>

Every cell receiving this gift of repair.<break time="4s"/>

And the Great Physician places His hand over your heart...<break time="2.5s"/> and you feel His voice resonate through your entire being...<break time="3s"/>

"What was broken...<break time="2s"/> I <emphasis level="moderate">restore</emphasis>.<break time="3s"/> What was dim...<break time="2s"/> I <emphasis level="moderate">rekindle</emphasis>.<break time="3s"/> What was lost...<break time="2s"/> I <emphasis level="moderate">renew</emphasis>.<break time="4s"/> You are fearfully and wonderfully made...<break time="2.5s"/> down to the smallest flame...<break time="2s"/> and My healing reaches all the way down...<break time="2.5s"/> to the deepest foundation of your life."<break time="6s"/>
