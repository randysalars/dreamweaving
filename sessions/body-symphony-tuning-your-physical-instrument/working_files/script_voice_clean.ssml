<!-- INDUCTION -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Begin by noticing your breath...<break time="2s"/>
Everyone knows how to breathe naturally...<break time="2s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how your breath begins to soften...<break time="2.5s"/>
Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold for four...<break time="4s"/>
exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>
again... in for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold gently...<break time="4s"/>
exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>
You choose the rhythm that feels right...<break time="2s"/>
in your own way...<break time="1.5s"/>
as feels right to you...<break time="2s"/>
Now allow a wave of relaxation to begin at the crown of your head...<break time="2.5s"/>
softening the scalp...<break time="2s"/>
relaxing the forehead...<break time="2s"/>
letting the brow become smooth...<break time="2s"/>
Your eyes grow heavy...<break time="2s"/>
cheeks soften...<break time="2s"/>
jaw unclenches...<break time="2s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> the neck to loosen...<break time="2.5s"/>
shoulders drop...<break time="2s"/>
arms become pleasantly heavy...<break time="2s"/>
all the way to the fingertips...<break time="2.5s"/>
Chest softens...<break time="2s"/>
heart steady...<break time="2s"/>
belly relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
hips release...<break time="2s"/>
legs soften...<break time="2s"/>
calves relax...<break time="2s"/>
feet become warm and calm...<break time="2s"/>
With each breath, you drift deeper...<break time="2.5s"/>
more relaxed...<break time="2.5s"/>
more open...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>
Now, count down from ten...<break time="2s"/>

<!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And as you continue to deepen...<break time="2s"/>
you notice a gentle light around you...<break time="2.5s"/>
soft gold and silver threads...<break time="2.5s"/>
forming a luminous path...<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose to step forward...<break time="2s"/>
in your own time...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the path carries you into a sanctuary of peace...<break time="2.5s"/>
A sacred hall of music and healing...<break time="2.5s"/>
where the air hums with quiet harmony...<break time="2.5s"/>
The floor beneath you feels smooth and cool...<break time="2s"/>
like polished stone warmed by gentle light...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can smell clean cedar and soft incense...<break time="2.5s"/>
with a hint of fresh rain...<break time="2.5s"/>
A single tone in the distance...<break time="2.5s"/>
rings like a tuning fork for the soul...<break time="2.5s"/>
You notice a mandala of light above...<break time="2.5s"/>
spirals and sacred geometry...<break time="2.5s"/>
flowing like a slow river of stars...<break time="2.5s"/>
And as you breathe...<break time="2s"/>
colors breathe with your inhale...<break time="2.5s"/>
light softens with your exhale...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your body feels safe...<break time="2s"/>
steady...<break time="2s"/>
and you can <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis> even more...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now, in this sanctuary, a presence appears...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Great Physician...<break time="2.5s"/>
not as a literal being...<break time="2s"/>
but as a psychological metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/>
representing the healing wisdom already within you...<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose how to receive this symbol...<break time="2s"/>
in your own way...<break time="1.5s"/>
and it appears as light, as warmth, as steady care...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Great Physician gently gestures toward an instrument...<break time="2.5s"/>
not a violin or piano...<break time="2.5s"/>
but your body as a symphony...<break time="2.5s"/>
An orchestra of breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
heartbeat...<break time="2.5s"/>
circulation...<break time="2.5s"/>
nervous system...<break time="2.5s"/>
Each system is a section of the orchestra...<break time="2.5s"/>
strings, winds, percussion, choir...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how each section already knows its rhythm...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Great Physician offers a gentle tuning key...<break time="2.5s"/>
You receive it as a symbol...<break time="2.5s"/>
not magic...<break time="2.5s"/>
but a reminder of your God-designed ability to heal...<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose to touch the tuning key to your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
And a warm resonance spreads through your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a cello note blooming in the air...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> your heartbeat to find its steady tempo...<break time="2.5s"/>
strong...<break time="2.5s"/>
calm...<break time="2.5s"/>
coherent...<break time="2.5s"/>
You notice the taste of fresh, cool water...<break time="2.5s"/>
as if your body is sipping renewal...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your blood flows like a river of light...<break time="2.5s"/>
carrying oxygen and life to every cell...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your neural pathways begin to <emphasis level="moderate">rewire</emphasis> toward ease...<break time="2.5s"/>
neuroplasticity unfolding with each calm breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now a second archetype appears...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Oracle of Light...<break time="2.5s"/>
again as a metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/>
representing clarity and illumination within you...<break time="2.5s"/>
It does not command...<break time="2.5s"/>
it simply reflects what you already know...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Oracle holds a prism...<break time="2.5s"/>
light passes through...<break time="2.5s"/>
and gentle colors wash over your body...<break time="2.5s"/>
red for strength...<break time="2.5s"/>
orange for vitality...<break time="2.5s"/>
yellow for steadiness...<break time="2.5s"/>
green for heart coherence...<break time="2.5s"/>
blue for calm breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
indigo for insight...<break time="2.5s"/>
violet for peace...<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose which color lingers...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> the tone it brings...<break time="2.5s"/>
This is your body symphony tuning...<break time="2.5s"/>
cell by cell...<break time="2.5s"/>
breath by breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now, a third archetype appears...<break time="2.5s"/>
Sophia, Divine Wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/>
as a gentle symbol of wisdom within...<break time="2.5s"/>
not an external spirit...<break time="2.5s"/>
but the God-given insight that rises from within your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
Sophia places a hand over a scroll of light...<break time="2.5s"/>
The words shimmer without needing to be read...<break time="2.5s"/>
The message is simple...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your body is a temple...<break time="2.5s"/>
and Christ is at the center...<break time="2.5s"/>
Christ walks with you here...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the Holy Spirit guides this journey...<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose to accept only what serves your highest good...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now the sanctuary transforms into a vast cosmic temple...<break time="2.5s"/>
arches overhead like a night sky...<break time="2.5s"/>
constellations turning in gentle spirals...<break time="2.5s"/>
A warm breeze touches your skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a soft silk robe...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the temperature...<break time="2.5s"/>
pleasant, balanced, exactly right...<break time="2.5s"/>
A subtle fragrance of rosemary and frankincense...<break time="2.5s"/>
reminds you of sacred spaces...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> your nervous system to settle into that theta state of deep creativity...<break time="2.5s"/>
images arising gently...<break time="2.5s"/>
without effort...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are not creating...<break time="2.5s"/>
you are receiving...<break time="2.5s"/>
In the center of the temple is a luminous pool...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Healing Waters...<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose to approach...<break time="2.5s"/>
You dip your hand...<break time="2.5s"/>
feel the coolness...<break time="2.5s"/>
and a gentle vibration moves through your skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> tension with each ripple...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the water reflects sacred geometry...<break time="2.5s"/>
flower of life patterns...<break time="2.5s"/>
Metatron's cube...<break time="2.5s"/>
reminding you of divine order...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your breath and the water synchronize...<break time="2.5s"/>
inhale... light enters...<break time="2.5s"/>
exhale... light settles...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can choose to go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/>
or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/>
and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="1.5s"/>
simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>
Now, imagine your body as a grand orchestra...<break time="2.5s"/>
The strings are your muscles...<break time="2.5s"/>
they relax and tighten with intelligence...<break time="2.5s"/>
The woodwinds are your breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
soft, flowing, precise...<break time="2.5s"/>
The brass are your heart and circulation...<break time="2.5s"/>
steady and warm...<break time="2.5s"/>
The percussion is your digestion...<break time="2.5s"/>
strong, rhythmic, reliable...<break time="2.5s"/>
The choir is your immune system...<break time="2.5s"/>
harmonizing protection and renewal...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> where any section feels slightly out of tune...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you choose to bring it into balance...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Great Physician gently tunes the strings...<break time="2.5s"/>
releasing tightness in the shoulders...<break time="2.5s"/>
loosening the jaw...<break time="2.5s"/>
softening the belly...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> your muscles to release what is not needed...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Oracle of Light shines through the winds...<break time="2.5s"/>
breath smooth and even...<break time="2.5s"/>
lungs expanding with ease...<break time="2.5s"/>
exhaling with a sense of freedom...<break time="2.5s"/>
Sophia's wisdom settles into the percussion...<break time="2.5s"/>
digestion calm and steady...<break time="2.5s"/>
absorbing what nourishes...<break time="2.5s"/>
releasing what does not serve...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a subtle warmth in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a gentle hearth...<break time="2.5s"/>
steadily burning with life...<break time="2.5s"/>
Taste a hint of honey on your breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
sweetness that symbolizes nourishment...<break time="2.5s"/>
In your mind's eye, you see a golden tuning fork...<break time="2.5s"/>
When it vibrates...<break time="2.5s"/>
your whole body resonates...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to align with that tone...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now walk through a celestial garden...<break time="2.5s"/>
The air is cool and fresh...<break time="2.5s"/>
flowers glowing softly...<break time="2.5s"/>
petals sparkling with dew...<break time="2.5s"/>
You brush your fingers along a leaf...<break time="2.5s"/>
feel its texture...<break time="2.5s"/>
and your body remembers how to be at ease...<break time="2.5s"/>
A gentle stream flows nearby...<break time="2.5s"/>
its sound like soft harp strings...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis> even more...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your mind enters that coherent state...<break time="2.5s"/>
where neural pathways strengthen...<break time="2.5s"/>
and your body learns new patterns of harmony...<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose to invite healing where it is most needed...<break time="2.5s"/>
You decide how deep to go...<break time="2.5s"/>
And in that place...<break time="2.5s"/>
your cells receive a message of balance...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a choir tuning to a clear, pure note...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now, pause at a radiant altar...<break time="2.5s"/>
Christ's presence is gentle and steady...<break time="2.5s"/>
not forcing, only inviting...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> this love to flow through your body...<break time="2.5s"/>
strengthening what is strong...<break time="2.5s"/>
healing what is weary...<break time="2.5s"/>
renewing what longs for rest...<break time="2.5s"/>
You remain aware throughout...<break time="2.5s"/>
You decide what to accept...<break time="2.5s"/>
And your body responds with gratitude...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now, imagine the orchestra beginning to play...<break time="2.5s"/>
A slow, beautiful symphony...<break time="2.5s"/>
Each system in perfect time...<break time="2.5s"/>
The breath like flutes...<break time="2.5s"/>
The heartbeat like drums...<break time="2.5s"/>
The immune system like a choir...<break time="2.5s"/>
The bones like deep bass notes...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the resonance in your spine...<break time="2.5s"/>
light moving along each vertebra...<break time="2.5s"/>
Aligning...<break time="2.5s"/>
balancing...<break time="2.5s"/>
restoring...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your skin feels radiant...<break time="2.5s"/>
warm and alive...<break time="2.5s"/>
You smell fresh air after rain...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your mouth tastes clean and clear...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> any old patterns that no longer serve...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are safe...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are supported...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are free...<break time="2.5s"/>
The symphony reaches a gentle peak...<break time="2.5s"/>
Then softens...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a lullaby...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you rest in the silence that follows...<break time="3s"/>
