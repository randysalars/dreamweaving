Welcome to Session Three: Deep Relaxation Journey.
<break time="1.2s"/>

This session takes you deeper than before.
<break time="700ms"/>
Into profound rest.
<break time="600ms"/>
Into stillness.
<break time="600ms"/>
Into the healing space that exists within you.
<break time="2s"/>

Over the next twenty-five minutes,
<break time="700ms"/>
you'll experience what deep relaxation truly feels like.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Not just surface calm,
<break time="600ms"/>
but the kind of rest that restores you at every level.
<break time="2s"/>

Make sure you're truly comfortable.
<break time="800ms"/>
Lying down is best for this session.
<break time="700ms"/>
Cover yourself with a blanket if you like.

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Let your eyes close now.
<break time="2s"/>

Take one deep breath in.
<break time="2.5s"/>
And release everything.
<break time="3s"/>

Another breath, even deeper.
<break time="2.5s"/>
And let go completely.
<break time="3s"/>

Good.
<break time="2s"/>

Now, imagine a warm, golden light beginning to gather at the very top of your head.
<break time="2s"/>
This light is pure relaxation.
<break time="1s"/>
Pure peace.
<break time="1s"/>
Pure healing.
<break time="2s"/>

Feel it spreading across your scalp.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Warming.
<break time="1s"/>
Softening.
<break time="1s"/>
Releasing any tension you didn't even know you were holding.
<break time="2.5s"/>

The light flows down across your forehead.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Smoothing the lines.
<break time="1s"/>
Relaxing the muscles around your eyes.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Down through your cheeks.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Releasing your jaw, which so often holds stress.
<break time="1s"/>
Let your mouth fall slightly open if that feels comfortable.
<break time="2.5s"/>

The golden light flows into your neck.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Down through each vertebra.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Releasing.
<break time="1s"/>
Softening.
<break time="1s"/>
Letting go.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Into your shoulders.
<break time="1.5s"/>
So much tension lives here.
<break time="1s"/>
Watch it dissolve in the warm light.
<break time="2s"/>

Down through your arms.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Through your elbows.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Your wrists.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Your hands becoming heavy and warm.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Your fingers tingling slightly as they relax completely.
<break time="3s"/>

The light fills your chest now.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Your heart softening.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Your breathing becoming effortless.
<break time="2s"/>

Down through your belly.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Release any holding here.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Let your stomach be soft.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Round.
<break time="1s"/>
Relaxed.
<break time="2.5s"/>

The golden light flows through your lower back.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Through your hips.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Into your thighs, heavy against the surface beneath you.
<break time="2s"/>

Down through your knees.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Your calves.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Your ankles.
<break time="1.2s"/>
And finally, filling your feet completely.
<break time="2s"/>

Your entire body is now filled with golden light.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Warm.
<break time="1s"/>
Heavy.
<break time="1s"/>
Completely at peace.
<break time="3s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Now, allow yourself to sink even deeper.
<break time="2s"/>

Imagine you are gently descending.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Like a leaf floating down through still water.
<break time="2s"/>
Slowly.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Effortlessly.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Deeply.
<break time="3s"/>

With each breath, you sink a little more.
<break time="2s"/>

Breath.
<break time="2.5s"/>
Deeper.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Breath.
<break time="2.5s"/>
Deeper still.
<break time="3s"/>

You are entering the realm of profound rest.
<break time="2s"/>
A place beneath thought.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Beneath worry.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Beneath doing.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Here, there is nothing you need to figure out.
<break time="2s"/>
Nothing you need to solve.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Nothing you need to be.
<break time="2.5s"/>

You are simply present.
<break time="2s"/>
Simply aware.
<break time="2s"/>
Simply at rest.
<break time="4s"/>

This is the healing space.
<break time="2s"/>
In this deep stillness, your body knows how to repair itself.
<break time="2s"/>
Your mind knows how to release what no longer serves you.
<break time="2s"/>
Your spirit knows how to restore itself.
<break time="3s"/>

You don't need to do anything.
<break time="2s"/>
Just be here.
<break time="2s"/>
Just rest.
<break time="4s"/>

<break time="10s"/>

If any thoughts arise, let them pass like distant clouds.
<break time="2s"/>
You don't need to follow them.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Simply notice.
<break time="1.5s"/>
And return to stillness.
<break time="4s"/>

<break time="10s"/>

You are safe here.
<break time="2s"/>
Completely safe.
<break time="2s"/>
Completely held.
<break time="2s"/>
Completely at peace.
<break time="5s"/>

<break time="15s"/>

In this state, insights may arise.
<break time="2s"/>
Answers to questions you've been holding.
<break time="2s"/>
Or simply a deep sense of okayness.
<break time="2s"/>
Whatever comes, receive it.
<break time="3s"/>

<break time="20s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Now, very slowly,
<break time="1.5s"/>
begin to allow awareness to return.
<break time="2s"/>

There's no rush.
<break time="2s"/>

First, become aware of sounds.
<break time="2s"/>
My voice.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Perhaps sounds in your environment.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Then, become aware of your body.
<break time="2s"/>
The weight of it.
<break time="1.5s"/>
The temperature.
<break time="1.5s"/>
The textures against your skin.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Begin to deepen your breath.
<break time="2s"/>
Slowly.
<break time="2s"/>
Gently.
<break time="3s"/>

Wiggle your fingers slightly.
<break time="2s"/>
Wiggle your toes.
<break time="2s"/>

Feel the life force returning to your limbs.
<break time="2.5s"/>

If you'd like, you can stretch gently.
<break time="2s"/>
Whatever your body needs right now.
<break time="3s"/>

Take your time.
<break time="2s"/>
There's no hurry to return.

When you're ready, gently open your eyes.

Welcome back.
<break time="2s"/>

Notice how different you feel.
<break time="1.5s"/>
This is true rest.
<break time="1s"/>
This is what your body and mind are capable of
<break time="700ms"/>
when given permission to let go completely.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Carry this peace with you.
