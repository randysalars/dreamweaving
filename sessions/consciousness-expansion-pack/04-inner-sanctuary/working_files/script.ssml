<!-- INDUCTION: 5 minutes -->
[SFX: Gentle chime, 2 seconds]

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Allow your eyes to close.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Take a deep breath in.
<break time="2s"/>
And release.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Another breath.
<break time="2s"/>
Let tension drain away.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Using what you've learned,
<break time="800ms"/>
allow relaxation to spread through your body.
<break time="1.5s"/>

From the top of your head.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Down through your face.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Your neck and shoulders.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Your arms and hands.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Through your chest and belly.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Your back and hips.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Down through your legs.
<break time="1.2s"/>
All the way to your feet.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Your body is relaxed.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Your mind is clear.
<break time="1.5s"/>
You are ready to build.
<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- JOURNEY: 13 minutes -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Imagine now that you're standing at the edge of a path.
<break time="2s"/>

This path leads to a very special place.
<break time="1.5s"/>
A place that exists only for you.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Your inner sanctuary.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Begin walking the path.
<break time="2s"/>

Notice what's around you.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Perhaps trees.
<break time="1s"/>
Perhaps mountains in the distance.
<break time="1s"/>
Perhaps open sky.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Whatever feels right for you.
<break time="2.5s"/>

As you walk, the world becomes more beautiful.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Colors deepen.
<break time="1s"/>
Air becomes fresher.
<break time="1s"/>
A sense of peace grows with each step.
<break time="3s"/>

Ahead, you see your sanctuary taking form.
<break time="2s"/>

What does it look like?
<break time="1.5s"/>

Perhaps it's a cottage in a forest glade.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Perhaps a temple on a mountain.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Perhaps a room of pure light.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Perhaps something else entirely.
<break time="2s"/>

There's no right answer.
<break time="1s"/>
Let it be whatever feels like home to you.
<break time="3s"/>

Approach your sanctuary now.
<break time="2s"/>

Notice the entrance.
<break time="1.5s"/>
How do you enter?
<break time="1.5s"/>
A door?
<break time="1s"/>
An archway?
<break time="1s"/>
A threshold of light?
<break time="2.5s"/>

Step inside.
<break time="3s"/>

Take a moment to look around.
<break time="2s"/>

Notice the space.
<break time="1.5s"/>
The light.
<break time="1.2s"/>
The colors.
<break time="1.2s"/>
The textures.
<break time="2s"/>

This is your creation.
<break time="1.5s"/>
You can make it exactly as you wish.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Perhaps there's a comfortable place to sit or lie down.
<break time="2s"/>
Go there now.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Settle in.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Feel how perfectly it supports you.
<break time="2s"/>

From here, you can see the entire space.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Notice details you might have missed.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Perhaps there's a window with a beautiful view.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Perhaps a fireplace with gentle flames.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Perhaps objects that hold meaning for you.
<break time="2.5s"/>

This sanctuary is a reflection of your deepest self.
<break time="2s"/>
A place of safety.
<break time="1s"/>
A place of wisdom.
<break time="1s"/>
A place of healing.
<break time="3s"/>

Know that you can return here anytime.
<break time="1.5s"/>
With a single breath and intention,
<break time="800ms"/>
you can step through that entrance
<break time="700ms"/>
and be in your sanctuary.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Take a few moments now to simply be here.
<break time="2s"/>
To feel the peace of this place.
<break time="2s"/>
To know it is always available to you.
<break time="5s"/>

<break time="15s"/>

<!-- INTEGRATION: 4 minutes -->
[SFX: Gentle bell, 3 seconds]

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Now, before you leave,
<break time="1.5s"/>
look around one more time.
<break time="2s"/>

Anchor this place in your memory.
<break time="1.5s"/>
The feeling of being here.
<break time="1.2s"/>
The sense of safety.
<break time="1.2s"/>
The peace.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Take a deep breath and let this feeling fill you.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Know that every time you take a breath like this
<break time="800ms"/>
and think of your sanctuary,
<break time="700ms"/>
you'll return to this feeling.
<break time="2.5s"/>

When you're ready,
<break time="1s"/>
gently begin to move toward the entrance.
<break time="2s"/>

Step through.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Walk back along the path.
<break time="2s"/>

With each step, becoming more aware of your physical body.
<break time="2s"/>

The room around you.
<break time="1.5s"/>
The sounds of the present moment.
<break time="2s"/>

Wiggle your fingers and toes.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Take a deep, grounding breath.
<break time="2.5s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- CLOSING: 1 minute -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Gently open your eyes.
<break time="2s"/>

Welcome back.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Your sanctuary is now built.
<break time="1s"/>
It exists within you.
<break time="1.2s"/>

Practice visiting it daily.
<break time="800ms"/>
Even for just a minute.
<break time="700ms"/>
The more you visit, the more real and accessible it becomes.
<break time="2s"/>

When you're ready for more,
<break time="700ms"/>
Session Five awaits: The Witness State.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Until then, remember:
<break time="700ms"/>
peace is never more than a breath away.
<break time="2s"/>
