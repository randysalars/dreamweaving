<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Welcome to this foundational session on grounding and presence.
<break time="1.2s"/>

Over the next fifteen minutes, you'll learn to anchor yourself in the present moment,
<break time="700ms"/>
a skill that becomes the foundation for all deeper work.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Before we begin, find a comfortable position.
<break time="800ms"/>
You can lie down or sit supported.
<break time="700ms"/>
Loosen any tight clothing.
<break time="700ms"/>
And know that you are completely safe here.
<break time="1.5s"/>

This is your time.
<break time="700ms"/>
There's nothing you need to do except follow my voice
<break time="600ms"/>
and allow yourself to relax.
<break time="1.2s"/>

If at any point you need to return to full wakefulness,
<break time="600ms"/>
you can simply open your eyes and take three deep breaths.
<break time="700ms"/>
You are always in control.
<break time="2s"/>
</prosody>

[SFX: Soft chime, 2 seconds]

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Now, let your eyes gently close.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose.
<break time="2s"/>
And release it slowly through your mouth.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Good.
<break time="1s"/>
Another breath in, filling your lungs completely.
<break time="2s"/>
And let it go, releasing any tension you've been holding.
<break time="2.5s"/>

With each breath, you settle more deeply into comfort.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Now, bring your attention to the top of your head.
<break time="1s"/>
Notice any sensation there, without judgment.
<break time="700ms"/>
Perhaps a warmth, or tingling, or simply awareness.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Let that awareness flow down through your forehead,
<break time="800ms"/>
softening the muscles around your eyes,
<break time="700ms"/>
releasing any tension in your jaw.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Allow your face to become completely relaxed.
<break time="2s"/>

This wave of relaxation continues down through your neck,
<break time="800ms"/>
across your shoulders,
<break time="700ms"/>
letting them drop away from your ears.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Down through your arms,
<break time="700ms"/>
through your elbows,
<break time="600ms"/>
your wrists,
<break time="600ms"/>
and out through your fingertips.
<break time="2s"/>

Feel the relaxation spreading through your chest,
<break time="800ms"/>
your back sinking into whatever supports you,
<break time="1s"/>
your belly softening with each exhale.
<break time="2s"/>

Down through your hips,
<break time="700ms"/>
your thighs,
<break time="600ms"/>
your knees,
<break time="600ms"/>
your calves,
<break time="600ms"/>
and finally, out through the soles of your feet.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Your entire body is now relaxed,
<break time="800ms"/>
supported,
<break time="600ms"/>
at ease.
<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Duration: 6 minutes | Pitch: -1st | Purpose: Grounding techniques -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Now, from this place of deep relaxation,
<break time="800ms"/>
we begin to anchor in the present moment.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Notice the weight of your body.
<break time="1s"/>
Feel the points of contact between your body and what supports you.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Perhaps your back, your shoulders, your heels.
<break time="1.5s"/>

This weight, this contact,
<break time="700ms"/>
is your anchor to the here and now.
<break time="2s"/>

Now, become aware of your breath.
<break time="1s"/>
Not changing it, simply noticing.
<break time="1.2s"/>
The gentle rise and fall of your chest.
<break time="1s"/>
The subtle movement of your belly.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Your breath is always happening in the present moment.
<break time="800ms"/>
It cannot happen in the past.
<break time="700ms"/>
It cannot happen in the future.
<break time="800ms"/>
Only now.
<break time="2s"/>

Each breath is an anchor to this moment.
<break time="2.5s"/>

If thoughts arise, and they will,
<break time="800ms"/>
simply notice them like clouds passing through a vast sky.
<break time="1s"/>
You are the sky, not the clouds.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Let them drift by,
<break time="700ms"/>
and return your attention to your breath.
<break time="2s"/>

Now, expand your awareness to include sounds.
<break time="1.2s"/>
Perhaps you can hear my voice,
<break time="700ms"/>
perhaps other sounds in your environment.
<break time="1s"/>
Without labeling them as good or bad,
<break time="700ms"/>
simply notice.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Sounds, too, anchor you in the present.
<break time="800ms"/>
They are always happening now.
<break time="2.5s"/>

You now have three anchors to the present moment:
<break time="1s"/>
The weight of your body.
<break time="1s"/>
The rhythm of your breath.
<break time="1s"/>
The sounds around you.
<break time="2s"/>

Whenever you feel scattered or anxious,
<break time="700ms"/>
you can return to any of these anchors.
<break time="1s"/>
They are always available.
<break time="800ms"/>
Always waiting.
<break time="700ms"/>
Always now.
<break time="3s"/>

Take a moment to appreciate this state.
<break time="1.2s"/>
This grounded, present awareness.
<break time="1s"/>
This is your natural state beneath all the noise.
<break time="1.5s"/>

You can return here anytime.
<break time="800ms"/>
With practice, it becomes easier.
<break time="700ms"/>
A familiar home within yourself.
<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

[SFX: Gentle bell, 3 seconds]

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Now, we begin to gently return.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Keep the sense of groundedness as you slowly become aware of the room around you.
<break time="1.2s"/>

Begin to deepen your breath.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Wiggle your fingers.
<break time="1s"/>
Wiggle your toes.
<break time="1s"/>

Feel the life and energy returning to your limbs.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Notice how you feel different than when we began.
<break time="1s"/>
More settled.
<break time="700ms"/>
More present.
<break time="700ms"/>
More grounded.
<break time="2s"/>

This feeling, this state,
<break time="700ms"/>
you can cultivate anytime.
<break time="800ms"/>
A few conscious breaths.
<break time="700ms"/>
Attention to body weight.
<break time="700ms"/>
Listening to sounds.
<break time="1.2s"/>

These simple practices, done regularly,
<break time="700ms"/>
become powerful anchors in your daily life.
<break time="2.5s"/>

When you're ready,
<break time="700ms"/>
at your own pace,
<break time="600ms"/>
allow your eyes to gently open.
<break time="2s"/>

Welcome back.
<break time="1.5s"/>

You've just completed the foundation.
<break time="800ms"/>
These skills of grounding and presence
<break time="600ms"/>
will serve you in every session that follows.
<break time="1.2s"/>

Practice this session daily for a week if you can.
<break time="800ms"/>
Then, when you feel ready,
<break time="600ms"/>
move on to Session Two: The Breath Gateway.
<break time="2s"/>

Until next time,
<break time="700ms"/>
stay grounded.
<break time="600ms"/>
Stay present.
<break time="600ms"/>
Stay connected to yourself.
