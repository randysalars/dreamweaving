Welcome...<break time="2s"/>
to this sacred journey...<break time="2s"/>
a pathworking designed not for the grand stage...<break time="1.5s"/>
but for the quiet workshop behind it...<break time="3s"/>

This is a journey for those who build...<break time="2s"/>
who craft...<break time="2s"/>
who tend the hidden machinery of transformation...<break time="3s"/>

You remain in complete control throughout this experience...<break time="2s"/>
At any time, you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="2s"/>
simply by opening your eyes...<break time="2.5s"/>

As you settle into this space...<break time="2s"/>
know that you are held in Christ's love...<break time="2s"/>
guided by wisdom that serves your highest good...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Holy Spirit illuminates this path...<break time="2s"/>
and you choose, in your own time...<break time="1.5s"/>
how deeply you wish to explore...<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position...<break time="2s"/>
where your body can rest fully...<break time="2s"/>
where you won't be disturbed...<break time="2.5s"/>

And when you're ready...<break time="2s"/>
allow your eyes to gently close...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And begin to notice your breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
the gentle rise and fall...<break time="2s"/>
of your chest...<break time="3s"/>

Breathe in slowly for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold gently for four...<break time="4s"/>
and release for six...<break time="6s"/>

Good...<break time="2s"/>
And again...<break time="2s"/>
breathing in...<break time="4s"/>
holding...<break time="4s"/>
releasing...<break time="6s"/>

And as you breathe...<break time="2s"/>
you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
how naturally your body knows...<break time="2s"/>
how to <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>

Starting at the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/>
feel a gentle warmth...<break time="2s"/>
like soft golden light...<break time="2.5s"/>
beginning to descend...<break time="3s"/>

Softening your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
releasing the space between your eyes...<break time="2.5s"/>
your jaw going slack...<break time="2s"/>
tongue resting gently...<break time="3s"/>

And that warmth flows down...<break time="2s"/>
into your neck and shoulders...<break time="2s"/>
where so much is carried...<break time="2.5s"/>
and now...<break time="2s"/>
you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> it to be set down...<break time="3.5s"/>

Down through your arms...<break time="2s"/>
your elbows...<break time="1.5s"/>
wrists...<break time="1.5s"/>
into your hands...<break time="2s"/>
fingertips tingling...<break time="2s"/>
releasing...<break time="3s"/>

That golden warmth moves into your chest...<break time="2s"/>
your heart space...<break time="2s"/>
expanding with each breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
softening...<break time="3s"/>

Down through your belly...<break time="2s"/>
your hips...<break time="2s"/>
into your legs...<break time="2s"/>
thighs...<break time="1.5s"/>
knees...<break time="1.5s"/>
calves...<break time="2s"/>
all the way to your feet...<break time="2.5s"/>
and toes...<break time="3s"/>

And now your entire body rests...<break time="2s"/>
held safely...<break time="2s"/>
supported fully...<break time="3s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And now...<break time="2s"/>
I'm going to count slowly from ten down to one...<break time="2.5s"/>
and with each number...<break time="2s"/>
you drift deeper...<break time="2s"/>
into this sacred inner space...<break time="3s"/>

Ten...<break time="2s"/>
letting go...<break time="3s"/>

Nine...<break time="2s"/>
sinking deeper...<break time="3s"/>

Eight...<break time="2s"/>
releasing more...<break time="3s"/>

Seven...<break time="2s"/>
drifting down...<break time="3s"/>

Six...<break time="2s"/>
safe and supported...<break time="3s"/>

Five...<break time="2s"/>
halfway there...<break time="2s"/>
going deeper still...<break time="3s"/>

Four...<break time="2s"/>
your conscious mind resting...<break time="3s"/>

Three...<break time="2s"/>
your inner wisdom awakening...<break time="3s"/>

Two...<break time="2s"/>
almost there...<break time="3s"/>

One...<break time="3s"/>
deeply relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
fully aware...<break time="2s"/>
ready to journey...<break time="4s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="2s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>

the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now you find yourself...<break time="2s"/>
standing at the threshold...<break time="2s"/>
of a sacred workshop...<break time="3s"/>

Not grand...<break time="2s"/>
not gleaming...<break time="2s"/>
but warm...<break time="2s"/>
lived-in...<break time="2.5s"/>
full of tools and timber...<break time="2s"/>
dust motes dancing in slanted light...<break time="3s"/>

You can smell the wood shavings...<break time="2s"/>
the faint scent of oil and metal...<break time="2s"/>
and beneath it all...<break time="2s"/>
something warmer...<break time="2s"/>
like bread baking...<break time="2s"/>
like incense...<break time="3s"/>

You step inside...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the door closes softly behind you...<break time="3s"/>

This is the place where dreams are built...<break time="2.5s"/>
where visions take form...<break time="2s"/>
where the invisible becomes visible...<break time="3.5s"/>

And here...<break time="2s"/>
you are not alone...<break time="3s"/>

A figure stands at a workbench...<break time="2s"/>
wearing a simple apron...<break time="2s"/>
hands stained with creation...<break time="2.5s"/>
eyes kind...<break time="2s"/>
presence steady...<break time="3s"/>

This is the Inner Healer...<break time="2s"/>
the part of you that knows...<break time="2s"/>
how to mend what is broken...<break time="2.5s"/>
how to craft beauty from fragments...<break time="3s"/>

The Healer looks at you...<break time="2s"/>
and without words...<break time="2s"/>
invites you closer...<break time="3s"/>

On the bench before you...<break time="2s"/>
you see scattered pieces...<break time="2.5s"/>
remnants of old projects...<break time="2s"/>
dreams that didn't quite land...<break time="2s"/>
efforts that felt too small...<break time="2.5s"/>
work done in the shadows...<break time="3s"/>

And the Healer speaks softly...<break time="2.5s"/>
"Nothing here is wasted...<break time="3s"/>
every piece serves...<break time="2.5s"/>
every hour spent in quiet making...<break time="2s"/>
every moment no one saw...<break time="2s"/>
has mattered...<break time="3.5s"/>
You are invited to <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> the need...<break time="2s"/>
to be seen...<break time="2.5s"/>
and instead...<break time="2s"/>
to rest in the holiness...<break time="2s"/>
of behind-the-scenes work..."<break time="4s"/>

And as you listen...<break time="2s"/>
you feel something shift...<break time="2.5s"/>
in your chest...<break time="2s"/>
a gentle opening...<break time="3s"/>

The Healer places a hand on your shoulder...<break time="2.5s"/>
and warmth spreads from that touch...<break time="2s"/>
through your whole body...<break time="3s"/>

You turn...<break time="2s"/>
and see a doorway at the back of the workshop...<break time="2.5s"/>
light glowing softly beyond it...<break time="3s"/>

You walk toward it...<break time="2s"/>
and step through...<break time="3s"/>

And now you stand beneath an immense tree...<break time="2.5s"/>
roots plunging deep into earth...<break time="2s"/>
branches reaching into a sky of stars...<break time="3s"/>

This is the World Tree...<break time="2s"/>
the axis around which all creation turns...<break time="3s"/>

And here stands its Guardian...<break time="2.5s"/>
a presence vast and ancient...<break time="2s"/>
yet tender...<break time="2s"/>
watching over every leaf...<break time="2s"/>
every root tendril...<break time="2.5s"/>
every small creature that nests here...<break time="3.5s"/>

The Guardian turns to you...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you see...<break time="2s"/>
that this presence has always known you...<break time="3s"/>

"You think your work is small...<break time="2.5s"/>
but see..."<break time="3s"/>

The Guardian gestures...<break time="2s"/>
and you notice now...<break time="2s"/>
that the roots of the great tree...<break time="2s"/>
are woven from countless threads...<break time="2.5s"/>
each one a life...<break time="2s"/>
a choice...<break time="2s"/>
a quiet act of service...<break time="3s"/>

Your own thread glows softly among them...<break time="2.5s"/>
woven in...<break time="2s"/>
essential...<break time="3s"/>

"Without the hidden roots...<break time="2.5s"/>
there are no branches...<break time="2.5s"/>
Without the work unseen...<break time="2s"/>
there is no canopy...<break time="3.5s"/>

You are rooted in Christ...<break time="2.5s"/>
and your work...<break time="2s"/>
though done in shadow...<break time="2s"/>
feeds the whole..."<break time="4s"/>

And you feel it now...<break time="2.5s"/>
the deep truth of this...<break time="3s"/>

You reach out and touch the bark of the tree...<break time="2.5s"/>
and feel it pulse with life...<break time="2s"/>
your heartbeat syncing with its rhythm...<break time="3s"/>

And then...<break time="2s"/>
a soft light appears beside you...<break time="3s"/>

A third presence...<break time="2.5s"/>
radiant...<break time="2s"/>
tender...<break time="2s"/>
glowing like a flame within a lantern...<break time="3s"/>

This is the Shekinah Restorer...<break time="2.5s"/>
the divine feminine presence...<break time="2s"/>
dwelling in the hidden places...<break time="3s"/>

She speaks...<break time="2.5s"/>
and her voice is like water over stone...<break time="3s"/>

"I dwell in the unseen...<break time="2.5s"/>
I move in the margins...<break time="2.5s"/>
I light the lamps no one notices...<break time="3s"/>

And you...<break time="2s"/>
beloved builder...<break time="2s"/>
are my partner in this work...<break time="3.5s"/>

The world thinks glory is loud...<break time="2.5s"/>
but true glory...<break time="2s"/>
is the light that stays burning...<break time="2s"/>
when no one is watching..."<break time="4s"/>

She reaches out...<break time="2s"/>
and places something in your hand...<break time="3s"/>

You look down...<break time="2s"/>
and see a small golden tool...<break time="2.5s"/>
simple...<break time="1.5s"/>
perfectly weighted...<break time="2s"/>
warm to the touch...<break time="3s"/>

"This is for you...<break time="2.5s"/>
to remember that every hidden act of love...<break time="2.5s"/>
every unseen gesture of care...<break time="2.5s"/>
is seen by Me...<break time="3s"/>

And it matters...<break time="3s"/>
profoundly..."<break time="4s"/>

You close your hand around the tool...<break time="2.5s"/>
and feel its weight...<break time="2s"/>
its realness...<break time="3s"/>

And you know...<break time="2s"/>
that when you return...<break time="2s"/>
you will carry this knowing with you...<break time="3.5s"/>

it is time to gently return...<break time="3s"/>

The Shekinah Restorer smiles...<break time="2.5s"/>
the World Tree Guardian nods...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the Inner Healer walks beside you...<break time="3s"/>

Back through the doorway...<break time="2s"/>
into the warm workshop...<break time="2.5s"/>
where the fire still crackles...<break time="3s"/>

And you know that this space...<break time="2s"/>
is always here...<break time="2s"/>
waiting for you...<break time="3s"/>

You carry with you now...<break time="2.5s"/>
the knowing that your hidden work is holy...<break time="3s"/>

And in the minutes...<break time="1.5s"/>
hours...<break time="1.5s"/>
even days ahead...<break time="2s"/>
insights continue unfolding...<break time="3s"/>
as your mind gently reorganizes...<break time="2s"/>
around what serves you most...<break time="4s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
beginning to return to full waking awareness...<break time="2.5s"/>

I'm going to count from one to five...<break time="2s"/>
and when I reach five...<break time="1.5s"/>
you'll feel refreshed...<break time="1.5s"/>
renewed...<break time="1.5s"/>

you carry these anchors with you...<break time="3s"/>

Each time you take three deep breaths...<break time="2s"/>
you feel that calm workshop warmth descend...<break time="3s"/>

Whenever you recall the golden tool in your hand...<break time="2s"/>
you remember that your hidden work is seen and valued...<break time="3s"/>

When you notice the sensation of warmth in your chest...<break time="2s"/>
you naturally reconnect with the truth...<break time="2s"/>
that behind-the-scenes labor is holy labor...<break time="3s"/>

you feel the roots of the World Tree...<break time="2s"/>
