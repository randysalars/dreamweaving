Welcome...<break time="2s"/>
to the Herblore Haven Dreamweaving...<break time="2.5s"/>
a sacred journey into the garden of healing wisdom...<break time="2s"/>
where every leaf...<break time="1s"/>
every root...<break time="1s"/>
every petal...<break time="1.5s"/>
holds the memory of earth's oldest medicine...<break time="3s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="1.5s"/>
you are invited to walk the pathways of an ancient garden...<break time="2s"/>
to meet the spirits of the healing plants...<break time="2s"/>
and to remember the healer that lives within you...<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe...<break time="2s"/>
fully aware...<break time="1.5s"/>
and in complete control throughout this experience...<break time="2.5s"/>
At any time...<break time="1s"/>
you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="1.5s"/>
simply by opening your eyes...<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/>
or lying down with your body fully relaxed...<break time="2.5s"/>
Allow your hands to rest softly...<break time="1.5s"/>
palms open...<break time="1s"/>
ready to receive...<break time="3s"/>

Ensure you will not be disturbed for the next half hour...<break time="2s"/>
Headphones will deepen your experience...<break time="1.5s"/>
though they are not required...<break time="3s"/>

And as you settle in...<break time="2s"/>
allow yourself to trust...<break time="1.5s"/>
that the garden knows you...<break time="2s"/>
that healing already lives within you...<break time="2s"/>
and that you need only remember...<break time="3.5s"/>

When you are ready...<break time="2s"/>
allow your eyes to gently close...<break time="4s"/>

And with your eyes closed...<break time="2.5s"/>
take a deep...<break time="1s"/>
nourishing breath in...<break time="3s"/>
filling your lungs with life...<break time="2s"/>
and as you exhale...<break time="2s"/>
release anything you no longer need...<break time="4s"/>

Breathe in again...<break time="1s"/>
slowly...<break time="1s"/>
for a count of four...<break time="4s"/>
hold gently at the top...<break time="4s"/>
and exhale for six...<break time="1s"/>
letting go...<break time="6s"/>

And again...<break time="1.5s"/>
breathing in calm...<break time="4s"/>
holding with ease...<break time="4s"/>
breathing out tension...<break time="6s"/>

Perfect...<break time="3s"/>

Now bring your awareness to your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
and notice any tightness there...<break time="2s"/>
any holding...<break time="2s"/>
and as you breathe...<break time="1.5s"/>
let that tightness <emphasis level="moderate">soften</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
let it <emphasis level="moderate">melt</emphasis>...<break time="3.5s"/>

Feel that softening move down...<break time="2s"/>
into your temples...<break time="1.5s"/>
around your eyes...<break time="1.5s"/>
across your cheeks...<break time="2s"/>
your jaw releasing...<break time="2s"/>
tongue resting gently in your mouth...<break time="3s"/>

And the deeper you relax...<break time="2s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

That wave of relaxation moves down now...<break time="2s"/>
into your neck...<break time="1.5s"/>
across your shoulders...<break time="2s"/>
feeling the weight drop away...<break time="2.5s"/>
as your shoulders settle...<break time="2s"/>
heavy...<break time="1.5s"/>
soft...<break time="1.5s"/>
safe...<break time="3.5s"/>

Down your arms now...<break time="2s"/>
into your elbows...<break time="1.5s"/>
forearms...<break time="1.5s"/>
wrists...<break time="1.5s"/>
all the way to the tips of your fingers...<break time="2s"/>
feeling warmth...<break time="2s"/>
or perhaps a gentle tingling...<break time="3s"/>

Your chest rises and falls...<break time="2s"/>
in its own rhythm...<break time="2s"/>
each breath carrying you deeper...<break time="3s"/>

And down into your belly...<break time="2s"/>
your lower back...<break time="2s"/>
hips releasing...<break time="2s"/>
thighs growing heavy...<break time="2.5s"/>

Down through your knees...<break time="1.5s"/>
calves...<break time="1.5s"/>
ankles...<break time="1.5s"/>
all the way to the soles of your feet...<break time="3s"/>

And now your whole body...<break time="2s"/>
from the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/>
to the tips of your toes...<break time="2s"/>
is deeply...<break time="1.5s"/>
completely...<break time="1.5s"/>

And as you rest here...<break time="2.5s"/>
so beautifully relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
I invite you now to imagine...<break time="2s"/>
or simply sense...<break time="2s"/>
that you are standing at the edge of a garden...<break time="3s"/>

Before you...<break time="2s"/>
a gentle path unfolds...<break time="2s"/>
made of smooth stone...<break time="2s"/>
warm beneath your feet...<break time="3s"/>

And as I count down from ten to one...<break time="2s"/>
with each number...<break time="1.5s"/>
you will take one step forward...<break time="2s"/>
down this path...<break time="2s"/>
deeper into the garden...<break time="2s"/>
deeper into relaxation...<break time="2s"/>
deeper into the healing space within you...<break time="4s"/>

Ten...<break time="1.5s"/>

Nine...<break time="1.5s"/>
deeper now...<break time="2s"/>
warmth on your skin...<break time="3s"/>

Eight...<break time="1.5s"/>

Seven...<break time="1.5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And here you are...<break time="2.5s"/>
standing at the entrance to the Herblore Haven...<break time="3s"/>

Before you...<break time="2s"/>
an arched gateway of living wood...<break time="2s"/>
roses twining up the posts...<break time="2s"/>
their petals the color of dawn...<break time="2.5s"/>
their fragrance...<break time="1.5s"/>
sweet...<break time="1s"/>
honeyed...<break time="1s"/>
opening something in your heart...<break time="4s"/>

You step through the gate...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the garden unfolds before you...<break time="3s"/>

Rows of raised beds stretch out in graceful curves...<break time="2s"/>
each one bursting with life...<break time="2.5s"/>
Lavender...<break time="1s"/>
its purple spikes swaying...<break time="2s"/>
Rosemary...<break time="1s"/>
woody and ancient...<break time="2s"/>
Thyme carpeting the edges in soft silver-green...<break time="3s"/>

The air here is alive...<break time="2s"/>
humming with the quiet song of growing things...<break time="3s"/>
You can feel it on your skin...<break time="2s"/>
warm...<break time="1s"/>
golden...<break time="1s"/>
like sunlight filtered through leaves...<break time="3.5s"/>

And as you walk deeper into the garden...<break time="2.5s"/>
you notice a figure...<break time="2s"/>
kneeling beside a bed of calendula...<break time="3s"/>

She looks up...<break time="2s"/>
and her eyes are kind...<break time="2s"/>
ancient...<break time="2s"/>
yet soft as spring...<break time="3s"/>

This is the <emphasis level="moderate">Rose Mother</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
the keeper of this haven...<break time="2s"/>
the one who knows every root...<break time="2s"/>
every leaf...<break time="2s"/>
every secret the soil holds...<break time="4s"/>

She rises...<break time="2s"/>
brushing earth from her hands...<break time="2s"/>
and she smiles at you...<break time="2.5s"/>
as if she has been expecting you...<break time="3.5s"/>

"Welcome, beloved,"<break time="2s"/>
she says...<break time="2s"/>
her voice like honey and rain...<break time="3s"/>
"You have come to remember...<break time="2s"/>
what your body already knows...<break time="3s"/>
that you are made of the same earth...<break time="2s"/>
the same medicine...<break time="2s"/>
the same healing light...<break time="3.5s"/>
as everything that grows here."<break time="4s"/>

She gestures...<break time="2s"/>
and you notice three paths leading deeper into the garden...<break time="3s"/>

The first...<break time="2s"/>
lined with chamomile and lemon balm...<break time="2s"/>
glows with a soft golden light...<break time="3s"/>

The second...<break time="2s"/>
bordered by hawthorn and yarrow...<break time="2s"/>
pulses with a gentle rose-red warmth...<break time="3s"/>

The third...<break time="2s"/>
framed by elder and mugwort...<break time="2s"/>
shimmers with silver and violet...<break time="3.5s"/>

"Choose the path that calls to you,"<break time="2s"/>
the Rose Mother whispers...<break time="3s"/>
"and meet the healer who waits there...<break time="3s"/>
a part of yourself...<break time="2s"/>
you have always known."<break time="4s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
without effort...<break time="2s"/>
you find yourself drawn...<break time="2s"/>
toward one of the paths...<break time="3s"/>
Your feet move naturally...<break time="2s"/>
as if the path itself is guiding you...<break time="4s"/>

As you walk...<break time="2s"/>
you feel the plants around you responding...<break time="2.5s"/>
Their leaves brush your hands...<break time="2s"/>
soft...<break time="1s"/>
welcoming...<break time="2s"/>
and with each touch...<break time="2s"/>
you feel something <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
something <emphasis level="moderate">open</emphasis>...<break time="3.5s"/>

The fragrance here is rich...<break time="2s"/>
layered...<break time="2s"/>
Mint and sage...<break time="1.5s"/>
earth and honey...<break time="1.5s"/>
wood smoke and rose...<break time="3s"/>

And then...<break time="2s"/>
you arrive...<break time="3s"/>

At the heart of the path...<break time="2s"/>
a clearing...<break time="2s"/>
and in the center...<break time="2s"/>
a figure of light...<break time="3.5s"/>

This is the <emphasis level="moderate">Inner Healer</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
radiant...<break time="2s"/>
whole...<break time="2s"/>
clothed in robes woven from living vines...<break time="3s"/>

They extend their hands to you...<break time="2.5s"/>
and in their palms...<break time="2s"/>
you see a small flame...<break time="2.5s"/>
golden...<break time="1.5s"/>
steady...<break time="1.5s"/>
warm...<break time="3s"/>

"This is your heart flame,"<break time="2s"/>
the Inner Healer says softly...<break time="3s"/>
"It has never gone out...<break time="2.5s"/>
even when you thought you were lost...<break time="3s"/>
This flame remembers...<break time="2s"/>
how to heal...<break time="2s"/>
how to restore...<break time="2s"/>
how to make whole."<break time="4s"/>

And as you gaze at the flame...<break time="2.5s"/>
you feel it <emphasis level="moderate">resonate</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
in your own chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
A warmth begins to glow...<break time="2s"/>
just beneath your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
spreading outward...<break time="2s"/>
filling you with light...<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer places a hand over your heart...<break time="3s"/>
and you feel the flame grow brighter...<break time="2.5s"/>
warmer...<break time="2s"/>
stronger...<break time="3.5s"/>

"You are the <emphasis level="moderate">Heart Flame Tender</emphasis>,"<break time="3s"/>
they whisper...<break time="2.5s"/>
"You tend this light...<break time="2s"/>
not only for yourself...<break time="2s"/>
but for all those who will walk this garden after you...<break time="3.5s"/>
Your healing...<break time="2s"/>
becomes their healing...<break time="3s"/>
Your wholeness...<break time="2s"/>
becomes their path."<break time="4s"/>

And you understand...<break time="3s"/>

The plants around you...<break time="2s"/>
the herbs and flowers...<break time="2s"/>
are not separate from you...<break time="3s"/>
They are allies...<break time="2s"/>
teachers...<break time="2s"/>
mirrors of the medicine already within you...<break time="4s"/>

Each leaf...<break time="2s"/>
a memory of resilience...<break time="3s"/>
Each root...<break time="2s"/>
a reminder of grounding...<break time="3s"/>
Each bloom...<break time="2s"/>
a celebration of beauty rising from soil...<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother appears beside you once more...<break time="3s"/>
and she places a small bundle in your hands...<break time="3s"/>

"These are seeds,"<break time="2s"/>
she says...<break time="2.5s"/>
"Plant them in your life...<break time="2s"/>
in your thoughts...<break time="2s"/>
in your choices...<break time="3s"/>
They will grow...<break time="2s"/>
and remind you...<break time="2s"/>
that you are a gardener of your own healing."<break time="4.5s"/>

You hold the seeds...<break time="2s"/>
and they are warm...<break time="2s"/>
alive...<break time="2s"/>
full of promise...<break time="3.5s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
the Inner Healer and the Rose Mother...<break time="2s"/>
both place their hands gently on your shoulders...<break time="3s"/>
and you feel a wave of love...<break time="2.5s"/>
so vast...<break time="2s"/>
so complete...<break time="2s"/>
that tears may come...<break time="3s"/>
and that is perfect...<break time="3.5s"/>

"You are never alone in your healing,"<break time="3s"/>
they say together...<break time="3s"/>
"We are always here...<break time="2s"/>
in the garden of your heart...<break time="3s"/>
tending the flame with you."<break time="4.5s"/>

the Inner Healer and the Rose Mother step back...<break time="2.5s"/>

The garden around you...<break time="2s"/>

the seeds in your hand remain...<break time="3s"/>
the knowing remains...<break time="4s"/>

It lives within you...<break time="2.5s"/>
always accessible...<break time="2s"/>
always tended...<break time="2s"/>
always blooming...<break time="4s"/>

let the essence of this experience...<break time="2s"/>
settle into your body...<break time="2.5s"/>
into your bones...<break time="2s"/>
into your cells...<break time="3.5s"/>

Feel the heart flame glowing steady...<break time="3s"/>
Feel the seeds resting in your awareness...<break time="3s"/>
Feel the love of the Rose Mother and the Inner Healer...<break time="2.5s"/>
woven into the fabric of who you are...<break time="4s"/>

And in the days ahead...<break time="2s"/>
you will notice...<break time="2s"/>
that healing comes more naturally...<break time="3s"/>
That self-compassion flows more easily...<break time="3s"/>
That you remember to tend your own heart flame...<break time="2.5s"/>
with the same care you would give to a sacred garden...<break time="4s"/>

And whenever you wish to return...<break time="2.5s"/>
all you need to do...<break time="2s"/>
is close your eyes...<break time="2s"/>
take three deep breaths...<break time="3s"/>
and imagine the scent of roses...<break time="2.5s"/>
or the warmth of your heart flame...<break time="3s"/>
and you will find yourself here...<break time="2.5s"/>
