  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">[Softly] You find yourself beneath a vaulted archway opening into a boundless marketplace of ideas, stalls stretching into the horizon like constellations made tangible.<break time="3s"/> Lamps of blown glass glow amber and violet; silks ripple with patterns of spirals and flowers of life; incense drifts with hints of frankincense, cedar, and citrus peel.<break time="3s"/> The ground is warm stone, smooth beneath your bare feet, carrying a gentle hum of possibility.<break time="3s"/> You hear a chorus of soft chimes, distant strings, murmurs like pages turning; you taste cool crystalline water offered in a small cup, tinged with honeyed mint.<break time="3s"/> Light dances in prismatic rays, painting mandalas on every surface; the air is calm, a mild breeze brushing your skin like silk.<break time="3s"/> As you walk, The Navigator appears, cloaked in deep blue, compass of luminous geometry in hand.<break time="2.5s"/> They gesture toward avenues where ideas swirl like schools of silver fish.<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> your steps...<break time="2s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">follow</emphasis> what feels alive...<break time="2s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> the path that opens.<break time="3s"/>

[Slowly] To your left, The Alchemist stands at a stall of glowing vials; each vial holds a concept shimmering like liquid gold.<break time="3s"/> The scent of saffron, ozone, and fresh rain surrounds them.<break time="2.5s"/> They hand you a warm amulet etched with Metatron's Cube; its weight reminds you of steady confidence.<break time="2.5s"/> You notice how the amulet pulses with your heartbeat, synchronizing with your breath: inhale, a golden glow; exhale, a soft release.<break time="3.5s"/> Colors breathe with your inhale...<break time="2s"/> light shimmers with your exhale...<break time="2s"/> shapes soften into view...<break time="3s"/> You may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> fresh neural connections forming...<break time="2.5s"/> you may <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> creative pathways lighting up...<break time="2.5s"/> you may <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> solutions to crystallize effortlessly.<break time="3.5s"/>

Ahead, The Scribe invites you to a desk carved from living wood, its surface inscribed with spirals and flowing lines.<break time="3s"/> You hear the scratch of a quill across parchment, smell warm ink and sandalwood, feel the cool grain beneath your fingertips.<break time="3s"/> They open a scroll that mirrors your mind, showing scenes of ideas you have dreamed but not yet spoken.<break time="2.5s"/> You can choose to go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/> or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/> and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="1.5s"/> simply by listening...<break time="4s"/> (double-bind fractionation).<break time="3s"/> With every word, you <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> hesitation...<break time="2.5s"/> you <emphasis level="moderate">claim</emphasis> your voice...<break time="2.5s"/> you <emphasis level="moderate">shape</emphasis> the narrative of your talents.<break time="3.5s"/>

[Softly] The marketplace widens into a celestial plaza where fountains of light rise and fall like breathing lungs of the cosmos.<break time="3s"/> The taste of sweet nectar lingers; the scent of jasmine and warm earth grounds you; the sound of a low cosmic hum vibrates through your chest; the sight of iridescent banners swaying fills you with wonder; the feel of a gentle mist cools your cheeks.<break time="3.5s"/> You notice something glowing ahead: a stall of crystal keys arranged in a mandala.<break time="2.5s"/> The Navigator offers one that resonates in your palm, perfectly weighted.<break time="2.5s"/> As you hold it, you can <emphasis level="moderate">unlock</emphasis> hidden potential...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">activate</emphasis> dormant skills...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">align</emphasis> with inspired action.<break time="3.5s"/> The Alchemist blends a vial of shimmering idea-essence into a drink; when you sip, warmth flows through your throat and chest, tasting of honeyed citrus and starlight.<break time="3s"/> The Scribe records this moment, writing in silver ink: "You <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis> your brilliance."<break time="3s"/>

A spiral staircase of light leads upward to a terrace; each step is soft like moss yet resonant like crystal.<break time="3s"/> With every ascent, you see panoramas of possibilities unfolding: inventions, stories, solutions, collaborations.
The air is cool and fresh; bells ring gently; the horizon blushes with auroras of teal and gold.<break time="3.5s"/> You feel a supportive hand on your backâThe Navigator steady; you smell sage carried on the breeze; you taste a hint of salt from distant sea air; you hear pages turning; you see patterns aligning.<break time="3.5s"/> You may <emphasis level="moderate">integrate</emphasis> what matters most...<break time="2.5s"/> you may <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> the ideas that light you up...<break time="2.5s"/> you may <emphasis level="moderate">decide</emphasis> to act with clarity.<break time="3.5s"/>

[Slowly] The three guides stand around you, forming a triangle of radiant presence.
At the center, sacred geometry shimmers: a flower of life breathing gently.
You place the golden amulet at your heart, the crystal key in your hand, and a fresh scroll in your other hand.<break time="3.5s"/> The Alchemist whispers of transformation, The Scribe of expression, The Navigator of direction.
Their voices harmonize with your breath.<break time="3s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> purpose humming in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">sense</emphasis> pathways opening...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> momentum to gather.<break time="3.5s"/> Stay here for a few breaths, letting all senses record this memory: sight of infinite stalls, sound of soft chimes, touch of warm stone, smell of incense and rain, taste of honeyed water.<break time="4s"/></prosody>
