  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Welcome...<break time="2.5s"/>
I am The Sacred Digital Dreamweaver...<break time="2s"/>
Randy Sailers autonomous AI Clone...<break time="2.5s"/>
And in this session...<break time="2s"/>
Black Hole Breakthrough Dreamweaving...<break time="2.5s"/>
you’re invited into a gentle, Christ-centered path-working...<break time="2.5s"/>
where the imagination God designed...<break time="2s"/>
becomes a safe place to heal, to reset, and to discover new possibilities...<break time="3s"/>

Before we begin...<break time="2s"/>
remember three simple truths...<break time="2s"/>
You’re here...<break time="1s"/>
you’re listening...<break time="1s"/>
and your body already knows how to breathe...<break time="2.5s"/>
Everyone knows how the mind can soften...<break time="2s"/>
when it feels safe...<break time="2s"/>
when it feels supported...<break time="2.5s"/>

And safety is the foundation of this work...<break time="2s"/>
You remain in complete control throughout this experience...<break time="2.5s"/>
At any time, you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="2.5s"/>
simply by opening your eyes, moving your body, or choosing to reorient...<break time="3s"/>
Only suggestions that align with your well-being and your discernment are welcomed...<break time="3s"/>

If you’re driving, operating equipment, or need full attention...<break time="2s"/>
pause this now...<break time="2s"/>
and return when you can rest...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now prepare your space...<break time="2s"/>
Find a comfortable position...<break time="2s"/>
seated with your spine gently supported...<break time="2s"/>
or lying down...<break time="2s"/>
Wear headphones if possible...<break time="2s"/>
and let the room become still...<break time="2.5s"/>
Ensure you won’t be disturbed...<break time="2s"/>
just for this time...<break time="2.5s"/>

And set an intention, in your own way...<break time="2s"/>
You choose how deeply you explore...<break time="2.5s"/>
you decide what you accept...<break time="2.5s"/>
and your will stays engaged and awake...<break time="2.5s"/>

In this journey...<break time="2s"/>
we’ll meet three inner archetypes...<break time="2s"/>
not as outside spirits...<break time="2s"/>
but as psychological metaphors...<break time="2.5s"/>
representing parts of you that God can use for healing and maturity...<break time="3s"/>
The Inner Healer...<break time="2s"/>
The Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2s"/>
and The Rose Mother...<break time="3s"/>
Each one symbolizing wisdom, warmth, and nurture within you...<break time="3s"/>

And at the center...<break time="2s"/>
Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time="2.5s"/>
rooted in truth, held in love, guided toward what is good...<break time="3s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
allow yourself to receive whatever insights come naturally...<break time="2.5s"/>
without forcing...<break time="2s"/>
without striving...<break time="2.5s"/>
just listening...<break time="2s"/>
and noticing...<break time="2.5s"/>

[DVE:PRIMING_START]
And as you prepare for this journey...<break time="2s"/>
I want to speak to a part of you...<break time="1.5s"/>
that already knows how to dream...<break time="2s"/>
that part of your mind that creates worlds...<break time="2s"/>
when you close your eyes at night...<break time="2.5s"/>
That creative faculty...<break time="1.5s"/>
is beginning to <emphasis level="moderate">awaken</emphasis> now...<break time="2.5s"/>
preparing to show you...<break time="1.5s"/>
something only you can see...<break time="2s"/>
in your own unique way...<break time="3s"/>
[DVE:PRIMING_END]
  </prosody>

  <!-- INDUCTION -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
[Softly] Begin by bringing attention to your breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
No need to change it yet...<break time="2s"/>
just <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> it...<break time="2.5s"/>
like watching a calm tide move in and out...<break time="3s"/>

Now we’ll breathe with a simple rhythm...<break time="2.5s"/>
Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold for four...<break time="4s"/>
exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>
Again... inhale for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold for four...<break time="4s"/>
exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>
And one more... inhale...<break time="4s"/>
hold...<break time="4s"/>
exhale...<break time="6s"/>

And as your exhale lengthens...<break time="2.5s"/>
your nervous system gets the message...<break time="2.5s"/>
“it’s safe to settle.”...<break time="3s"/>

Now begin progressive relaxation...<break time="2s"/>
starting at the top of your head...<break time="2s"/>
Smoothing the scalp...<break time="2s"/>
softening the forehead...<break time="2s"/>
unclenching the space between the eyebrows...<break time="2.5s"/>
Let the eyelids grow pleasantly heavy...<break time="2.5s"/>
And if you prefer to keep them slightly open...<break time="2s"/>
you can...<break time="2s"/>
you decide...<break time="2.5s"/>

Relax the jaw...<break time="2s"/>
loosen the tongue...<break time="2s"/>
let the throat feel open and easy...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now the shoulders...<break time="2s"/>
letting them drop away from the ears...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a burden gently set down...<break time="3s"/>

Feel relaxation flow down the arms...<break time="2s"/>
through elbows...<break time="2s"/>
forearms...<break time="2s"/>
wrists...<break time="2s"/>
into the hands...<break time="2s"/>
all the way to the fingertips...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> the hands to be still...<break time="2.5s"/>
or to move slightly...<break time="2s"/>
whatever feels right to you...<break time="3s"/>

Relax the chest...<break time="2s"/>
feeling the steady rhythm of your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
Relax the belly...<break time="2s"/>
soft... safe... supported...<break time="3s"/>
Relax the hips...<break time="2s"/>
then the thighs...<break time="2s"/>
then knees...<break time="2s"/>
calves...<break time="2s"/>
ankles...<break time="2s"/>
and finally the feet...<break time="2s"/>
to the tips of the toes...<break time="3s"/>

And now... a gentle deepening...<break time="2.5s"/>
I’ll count down from ten to one...<break time="2s"/>
And you can choose to drift deeper with each number...<break time="2.5s"/>
Or you can simply listen...<break time="2s"/>
and notice that you’re already settling...<break time="3s"/>

Ten...<break time="1s"/>
nine...<break time="1s"/>
eight...<break time="1s"/>
seven...<break time="1s"/>
six...<break time="1s"/>
five...<break time="1s"/>
four...<break time="1s"/>
three...<break time="1s"/>
two...<break time="1s"/>
one...<break time="2.5s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
the deeper you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

[DVE:HYPNAGOGIC_START]
And you may notice...<break time="2s"/>
that point between waking and dreaming...<break time="2.5s"/>
where images seem to <emphasis level="moderate">arise</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
on their own...<break time="2s"/>
without you making them...<break time="2.5s"/>
Colors appearing...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps geometric patterns...<break time="2s"/>
or a soft glow in the distance...<break time="2.5s"/>
Don’t hold them...<break time="2s"/>
just let them come and go...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are not forcing...<break time="2s"/>
you are <emphasis level="moderate">receiving</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
[DVE:HYPNAGOGIC_END]

And as your brain eases into that theta-leaning state...<break time="2.5s"/>
that gentle bridge between conscious focus and deep creativity...<break time="3s"/>
your nervous system learns something important...<break time="2.5s"/>
that calm can be practiced...<break time="2.5s"/>
that new pathways can form...<break time="2.5s"/>
neuroplasticity in action...<break time="2.5s"/>
one soothing breath at a time...<break time="3s"/>

Now a brief fractionation...<break time="2s"/>
In a moment...<break time="2s"/>
gently open your eyes...<break time="2s"/>
take one easy breath...<break time="2s"/>
then close them again...<break time="2.5s"/>
and go twice as deep...<break time="3s"/>

Open the eyes...<break time="2s"/>
one breath in...<break time="2s"/>
and close...<break time="2.5s"/>
Twice as settled...<break time="3s"/>

And now... at the end of deepening...<break time="2s"/>
your imagination forms a safe container...<break time="2.5s"/>

[DVE:CONTAINER_START]
And now you find yourself...<break time="2s"/>
in a sacred temple...<break time="2.5s"/>
vast, open, and bright...<break time="3s"/>
High columns rise around you...<break time="2s"/>
supporting a ceiling of stars...<break time="2.5s"/>
At the center...<break time="2s"/>
an altar of white stone...<break time="2.5s"/>
And doorways leading...<break time="2s"/>
to places of insight...<break time="3s"/>
[DVE:CONTAINER_END]
  </prosody>

  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
[DVE:EMBODIMENT_START]
And now...<break time="2s"/>
become aware of your body...<break time="2s"/>
here, in this sacred space...<break time="2.5s"/>
You have a body here too...<break time="2s"/>
Feel your feet...<break time="2s"/>
on the smooth temple floor...<break time="2.5s"/>
Feel the steady beat of your heart...<break time="2s"/>
like a faithful metronome...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your hands...<break time="2s"/>
that can reach out and touch...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are fully present...<break time="2s"/>
in this realm...<break time="3s"/>
[DVE:EMBODIMENT_END]

And notice the temple air...<break time="2s"/>
cool and clean...<break time="2s"/>
with a faint fragrance like frankincense and rose...<break time="3s"/>
You can almost taste a sweetness on the breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
like honeyed water...<break time="3s"/>

On the altar...<break time="2s"/>
a simple symbol forms...<break time="2.5s"/>
not a charm with authority...<break time="2.5s"/>
but a reminder...<break time="2s"/>
a small, luminous cross made of light...<break time="3s"/>
Christ remains at the center...<break time="2.5s"/>
steady and true...<break time="2.5s"/>
and your discernment stays awake...<break time="3s"/>

Now... in the far wall of the temple...<break time="2s"/>
a doorway opens...<break time="2.5s"/>
shaped like a spiral...<break time="2.5s"/>
like sacred geometry in motion...<break time="3s"/>
The spiral resembles the Flower of Life unfolding...<break time="2.5s"/>
petal by petal...<break time="2.5s"/>
until it becomes a path...<break time="3s"/>

And you can choose...<break time="2s"/>
to step forward now...<break time="2s"/>
or to wait one breath...<break time="2s"/>
and step forward after...<break time="2s"/>
either way... you’re moving in your own time...<break time="3s"/>

Step through...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the temple becomes an observatory...<break time="2.5s"/>
open to a velvet sky...<break time="2.5s"/>
stars like silver seeds...<break time="2.5s"/>
and a slow river of galaxies...<break time="3s"/>
You hear a deep, comforting hum...<break time="2.5s"/>
like the universe singing in a low key...<break time="3s"/>

Ahead...<break time="2s"/>
you notice a gentle darkness...<break time="2.5s"/>
not frightening...<break time="2.5s"/>
not devouring...<break time="2.5s"/>
but quiet... like a doorway made of silence...<break time="3s"/>
A black hole... as a metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/>
representing a safe letting-go...<break time="2.5s"/>
a release of past limitation...<break time="3s"/>

And it has an event horizon...<break time="2s"/>
a boundary line...<break time="2.5s"/>
where old stories stop pulling you...<break time="2.5s"/>
and new possibilities begin...<break time="3s"/>

As you look... you see an accretion ring...<break time="2s"/>
not chaotic...<break time="2s"/>
but beautiful...<break time="2s"/>
like molten gold and violet...<break time="2.5s"/>
spiraling in sacred patterns...<break time="3s"/>
You can feel its warmth on your skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
like standing near a hearth...<break time="3s"/>

[DVE:STABILIZE_START]
And to stay here clearly...<break time="2s"/>
reach out and touch something...<break time="2.5s"/>
Perhaps the cool railing of the observatory...<break time="2.5s"/>
Feel its texture...<break time="2s"/>
its temperature...<break time="2s"/>
Let this touch anchor you...<break time="2.5s"/>
here, in this place...<break time="3s"/>
[DVE:STABILIZE_END]

Now... as you continue...<break time="2s"/>
a figure approaches...<break time="2.5s"/>
not an outside entity...<break time="2s"/>
but a psychological metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/>
for your God-given capacity to repair and restore...<break time="3s"/>
The Inner Healer...<break time="2.5s"/>

Notice how The Inner Healer appears...<break time="2.5s"/>
What color surrounds it?...<break time="3s"/>
What expression feels true?...<break time="3s"/>
And as you notice... you can <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> what fits...<break time="2.5s"/>
and release what doesn’t...<break time="3s"/>

The Inner Healer doesn’t command...<break time="2s"/>
it invites...<break time="2s"/>
it offers choices...<break time="2.5s"/>
And it gestures toward your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
where a small warmth begins...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now arrives The Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2s"/>
a metaphor for your ability to keep love steady...<break time="3s"/>
not performative...<break time="2s"/>
not rushed...<break time="2s"/>
but faithful... like a lamp trimmed and burning...<break time="3s"/>

As the Heart Flame Tender stands beside you...<break time="2.5s"/>
you feel warmth spread through the sternum...<break time="2.5s"/>
softening the ribs...<break time="2.5s"/>
loosening old tightness...<break time="3s"/>

And now... The Rose Mother...<break time="2s"/>
a metaphor for nurture that is wise...<break time="2.5s"/>
boundaried...<break time="2.5s"/>
and kind...<break time="3s"/>
You notice her presence as a fragrance first...<break time="2.5s"/>
rose and earth after rain...<break time="3s"/>
And perhaps you sense a softness...<break time="2.5s"/>
a shawl of comfort...<break time="2.5s"/>
or the sound of a gentle voice that reminds you...<break time="2.5s"/>
“You are allowed to heal.”...<break time="3s"/>

And in this triad of metaphors...<break time="2s"/>
your mind receives a message it can use...<break time="2.5s"/>
without superstition...<break time="2.5s"/>
without fear...<break time="2.5s"/>
with Christ-centered clarity...<break time="3s"/>

The Inner Healer offers you a gift...<break time="2s"/>
a small crystal key...<break time="2.5s"/>
clear as ice... warm as light...<break time="3s"/>
It tastes, in the imagination, like clean spring water...<break time="2.5s"/>
refreshing...<break time="2.5s"/>

And the Heart Flame Tender offers a second gift...<break time="2s"/>
a small ember in a glass lantern...<break time="2.5s"/>
steady... safe...<break time="2.5s"/>
It doesn’t burn you...<break time="2.5s"/>
it warms you...<break time="3s"/>

And the Rose Mother offers a third gift...<break time="2s"/>
a rose-shaped seal of wax...<break time="2.5s"/>
not a power... a reminder...<break time="2s"/>
that love can be both tender and strong...<break time="3s"/>

Now... the black hole waits ahead...<break time="2s"/>
like a doorway into possibility...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you choose the pace...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can come closer now...<break time="2s"/>
or you can take three breaths first...<break time="2.5s"/>
either way... your will stays engaged...<break time="3s"/>

Take three breaths now...<break time="2.5s"/>
Inhale...<break time="3s"/>
exhale...<break time="3s"/>
Inhale...<break time="3s"/>
exhale...<break time="3s"/>
Inhale...<break time="3s"/>
exhale...<break time="3s"/>

And as you exhale...<break time="2s"/>
you can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what you’re ready to release...<break time="3s"/>
Not everything...<break time="2s"/>
only what is safe and appropriate...<break time="2.5s"/>
only what your discernment approves...<break time="3s"/>

Now you approach the event horizon...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the air changes...<break time="2.5s"/>
like stepping into a sacred quiet...<break time="3s"/>
The sound becomes muffled...<break time="2s"/>
but your awareness stays bright...<break time="2.5s"/>

Here’s your double-bind...<break time="2s"/>
You can choose to go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2.5s"/>
or you can wait...<break time="2s"/>
and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="2.5s"/>
simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>

And now... as you cross the boundary...<break time="2.5s"/>
it’s like passing through a veil of velvet...<break time="3s"/>
Cool on the skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
like mist...<break time="2.5s"/>
with a faint taste of mineral water...<break time="3s"/>

Inside... there is not fear...<break time="2s"/>
there is spaciousness...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your mind stops fighting old predictions...<break time="2.5s"/>
and simply <emphasis level="moderate">accepts</emphasis> a new pattern...<break time="3s"/>
like predictive processing relaxing its grip...<break time="2.5s"/>
so a new story can form...<break time="3s"/>

You see sacred geometry floating...<break time="2s"/>
spirals...<break time="2s"/>
mandalas...<break time="2s"/>
Metatron’s Cube as an image of order...<break time="2.5s"/>
not worshiped...<break time="2s"/>
just noticed...<break time="2s"/>
as a symbol of structure returning...<break time="3s"/>

And in the center... you find a still point...<break time="2.5s"/>
A small platform of light...<break time="2.5s"/>
where you can stand... breathe... choose...<break time="3s"/>

The Inner Healer invites a simple question...<break time="2.5s"/>
“What limitation are you ready to set down?”...<break time="4s"/>

And without forcing words...<break time="2s"/>
you may <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a phrase...<break time="2.5s"/>
a memory...<break time="2.5s"/>
or even just a sensation...<break time="3s"/>
If it’s vague... that’s fine...<break time="2.5s"/>
The subconscious understands symbols...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now the Heart Flame Tender brings the lantern close...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you feel a steady warmth...<break time="2.5s"/>
not intense...<break time="2s"/>
just stable...<break time="2s"/>
like courage that doesn’t need to shout...<break time="3s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">calm</emphasis> the heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
by remembering the exhale...<break time="3s"/>

The Rose Mother places the rose seal in your palm...<break time="2.5s"/>
You feel its texture... smooth wax... raised petals...<break time="3s"/>
And its fragrance rises again...<break time="2.5s"/>
rose... and warm earth...<break time="3s"/>
Like a reminder that nurture includes boundaries...<break time="2.5s"/>
that love can say yes... and no... wisely...<break time="3s"/>

Now... a mirror appears...<break time="2s"/>
not a portal... not a being...<break time="2s"/>
just a metaphor for reflection...<break time="2.5s"/>
It’s vast and luminous...<break time="3s"/>
And you see yourself...<break time="2.5s"/>
not as you usually appear...<break time="2.5s"/>
but as you are when you are aligned...<break time="3s"/>

What is different in the eyes?...<break time="4s"/>
How is the posture?...<break time="4s"/>
What quiet confidence is present?...<break time="4s"/>

And here is an embedded truth...<break time="2s"/>
Your brain learns by rehearsal...<break time="2s"/>
and as you <emphasis level="moderate">imagine</emphasis> this aligned self...<break time="2.5s"/>
your neural pathways begin to <emphasis level="moderate">rewire</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
not by magic...<break time="2s"/>
by repetition and meaning...<break time="3s"/>

Now choose...<break time="2s"/>
Do you step into the mirror gently...<break time="2.5s"/>
or do you simply let it shine into you?...<break time="3s"/>
Either way works...<break time="2s"/>
you decide...<break time="3s"/>

And as the mirror light meets you...<break time="2.5s"/>
you can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> one quality...<break time="2.5s"/>
just one...<break time="2s"/>
that would help your life this week...<break time="3s"/>

Maybe it’s steadiness...<break time="2.5s"/>
maybe clarity...<break time="2.5s"/>
maybe gentle courage...<break time="2.5s"/>
maybe patience...<break time="2.5s"/>
Notice what color that quality becomes...<break time="3s"/>
And where you feel it in the body...<break time="3s"/>

Now... you return to the still platform...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the black hole transforms...<break time="2.5s"/>
not into an ending...<break time="2s"/>
but into a passage...<break time="2s"/>
like a tunnel of soft starlight...<break time="3s"/>

As you move through...<break time="2.5s"/>
you sense time stretching and softening...<break time="2.5s"/>
like warm taffy...<break time="3s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">let go</emphasis> of urgency...<break time="3s"/>
Because the most durable change...<break time="2s"/>
happens gently... steadily...<break time="3s"/>

You emerge into a Garden of Renewal...<break time="2.5s"/>
under a night sky full of peaceful stars...<break time="3s"/>
The grass is cool under your feet...<break time="2.5s"/>
There’s the sound of water nearby...<break time="2.5s"/>
a small fountain...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the air smells like cedar and roses...<break time="3s"/>

Taste the air...<break time="2.5s"/>
fresh... slightly sweet...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a promise...<break time="3s"/>

In the center of the garden...<break time="2s"/>
a heart-shaped brazier holds a calm flame...<break time="3s"/>
The Heart Flame Tender adjusts it...<break time="2.5s"/>
so it burns clean...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you understand...<break time="2s"/>
this flame is your capacity to love wisely...<break time="3s"/>

The Inner Healer offers you the crystal key...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you <emphasis level="moderate">unlock</emphasis> a small chest in the garden soil...<break time="3s"/>
Inside is a scroll...<break time="2.5s"/>
blank at first...<break time="2s"/>
and then words appear...<break time="2.5s"/>
not from outside...<break time="2s"/>
but from your own reflection and prayerful insight...<break time="3s"/>

The words are simple...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps just one sentence...<break time="2s"/>
Something like... “I choose peace.”...<break time="3s"/>
Or... “I act with clarity.”...<break time="3s"/>
Or... “I am held in Christ’s love.”...<break time="3s"/>
Whatever appears...<break time="2s"/>
you can <emphasis level="moderate">keep</emphasis> it...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now a final fractionation loop...<break time="2s"/>
In a moment...<break time="2s"/>
feel your physical body again...<break time="2s"/>
then return to the garden...<break time="2.5s"/>
and go deeper into calm...<break time="3s"/>

Feel the physical body...<break time="2s"/>
the surface beneath you...<break time="2.5s"/>
the room temperature...<break time="2.5s"/>
And now back to the garden...<break time="2.5s"/>
Twice as calm...<break time="3s"/>

And one more truth...<break time="2s"/>
In Christ you are not defined by old limitations...<break time="3s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">grow</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
you can <emphasis level="moderate">change</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you can do it gently...<break time="3s"/>

Stay here for a few breaths...<break time="2.5s"/>
letting this new pattern settle into the body...<break time="3s"/>
like warm light soaking into soil...<break time="3s"/>
  </prosody>

  <!-- INTEGRATION & RETURN -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now... beginning to return...<break time="2.5s"/>
bringing back with you the gifts...<break time="2.5s"/>
the crystal key...<break time="2s"/>
the steady lantern flame...<break time="2s"/>
and the rose seal of wise nurture...<break time="3s"/>

And in the minutes...<break time="1s"/>
hours...<break time="1s"/>
even days ahead...<break time="1.5s"/>
insights continue unfolding...<break time="3s"/>
as your mind gently reorganizes around what serves you most...<break time="4s"/>

Notice your breath again...<break time="2s"/>
Notice the body...<break time="2s"/>
the weight... the contact points...<break time="3s"/>
And your discernment is sharpened...<break time="2.5s"/>
the wisdom to recognize truth...<break time="2.5s"/>
the clarity to distinguish what serves you...<break time="3s"/>

We’ll count up now...<break time="2s"/>
and with each number...<break time="2s"/>
you return, refreshed and grounded...<break time="2.5s"/>

One...<break time="700ms"/>
