Welcome.<break time="2s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="1.5s"/> you are invited on a transformational journey...<break time="2s"/> deep into the ancient world of Babylonia...<break time="2s"/> where the Epic of Gilgamesh...<break time="1.5s"/> one of humanity's oldest stories...<break time="2s"/> will become your pathway to heroic self-discovery.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe...<break time="1.5s"/> fully in control...<break time="1.5s"/> able to return to normal awareness at any moment you choose.<break time="2.5s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/> perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/> or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/>

Allow your eyes to close when you're ready...<break time="2s"/> and take a deep, nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/> breathing in possibility...<break time="2s"/> and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="3.5s"/>

This journey will guide you through the ancient gates of Uruk...<break time="2s"/> into the cedar forests of legend...<break time="2s"/> and to the shores of wisdom itself.<break time="2.5s"/>

You will encounter The Inner Healer...<break time="1.5s"/> who knows the medicine your soul requires...<break time="2.5s"/> The World Tree Guardian...<break time="1.5s"/> who holds the axis between earth and heaven...<break time="2.5s"/> and The Rose Mother...<break time="1.5s"/> whose compassion transforms all it touches.<break time="3s"/>

You will walk as Gilgamesh walked...<break time="2s"/> not to conquer...<break time="1.5s"/> but to <emphasis level="moderate">discover</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/> not to fear death...<break time="1.5s"/> but to embrace life more fully.<break time="3.5s"/>

Feel it soften your forehead...<break time="2.5s"/> releasing any tension there...<break time="2s"/> smoothing the space between your eyebrows...<break time="2.5s"/> allowing your eyelids to grow heavy...<break time="2s"/> so heavy...<break time="2s"/> as if weighted with sacred stones.<break time="3.5s"/>

The wave continues...<break time="2s"/> flowing down through your jaw...<break time="2s"/> your neck...<break time="2s"/> your shoulders...<break time="2.5s"/> and as it flows...<break time="1.5s"/> muscles you didn't even know were tight...<break time="2s"/> begin to <emphasis level="moderate">soften</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis>.<break time="3.5s"/>

Down through your chest now...<break time="2s"/> your heart space expanding...<break time="2s"/> your breath deepening...<break time="2.5s"/> as if the very air of ancient Mesopotamia...<break time="2s"/> fragrant with cedar and myrrh...<break time="2s"/> fills your lungs.<break time="3.5s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="2s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="2.5s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go.<break time="4s"/>

Your arms now...<break time="2s"/> heavy and relaxed...<break time="2s"/> your hands resting comfortably...<break time="2.5s"/> each finger releasing...<break time="2s"/> one by one.<break time="3s"/>

The golden wave flows through your abdomen...<break time="2s"/> your hips...<break time="2s"/> your legs...<break time="2.5s"/> all the way down to your feet...<break time="2s"/> and into the earth beneath you.<break time="3.5s"/>

You stand now...<break time="2.5s"/> at the great gates of Uruk...<break time="2s"/> the city of Gilgamesh.<break time="3s"/>

Before you rise walls of sun-baked brick...<break time="2s"/> towering and ancient...<break time="2s"/> etched with cuneiform prayers...<break time="2.5s"/> and crowned with cedars from distant mountains.<break time="3.5s"/>

The air is warm...<break time="2s"/> carrying the scent of barley bread baking...<break time="2s"/> of incense burning in distant temples...<break time="2s"/> of the river beyond the walls.<break time="3s"/>

You can hear...<break time="2s"/> the call of vendors in the marketplace...<break time="2s"/> the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith's hammer...<break time="2s"/> and beneath it all...<break time="1.5s"/> the whisper of something calling you forward.<break time="4s"/>

The gates open before you...<break time="2.5s"/> not with force...<break time="1.5s"/> but with recognition...<break time="2s"/> as if they have been waiting for you...<break time="2s"/> across four thousand years.<break time="4s"/>

And as you step through...<break time="2.5s"/> you notice a figure approaching...<break time="2.5s"/> robed in deep indigo...<break time="2s"/> carrying the staff of healing...<break time="2s"/> adorned with symbols of the serpent and the lotus.<break time="3.5s"/>

This is The Inner Healer...<break time="2.5s"/> the one who knows the medicine...<break time="2s"/> that your soul has been seeking.<break time="3.5s"/>

The Healer's eyes meet yours...<break time="2.5s"/> and without words...<break time="2s"/> you understand...<break time="2s"/> that every hero's journey...<break time="1.5s"/> begins with acknowledging...<break time="2s"/> what needs to be healed.<break time="4s"/>

The Healer places a warm hand over your heart...<break time="3s"/> and you feel...<break time="2s"/> a gentle pulse of light...<break time="2s"/> radiating outward...<break time="2.5s"/> dissolving old wounds...<break time="2s"/> releasing ancient griefs...<break time="2.5s"/> making space for what is to come.<break time="4.5s"/>

You breathe in healing...<break time="3s"/> and breathe out all that no longer serves.<break time="4s"/>

The Healer nods...<break time="2s"/> and gestures toward a path...<break time="2s"/> leading beyond the city...<break time="2s"/> toward a forest of incredible beauty.<break time="3.5s"/>

The landscape shifts around you...<break time="2.5s"/> and you find yourself entering...<break time="2s"/> the legendary Cedar Forest...<break time="2.5s"/> where Gilgamesh and Enkidu once walked.<break time="3.5s"/>

The trees here are immense...<break time="2.5s"/> their trunks wider than temple columns...<break time="2s"/> their branches reaching so high...<break time="2s"/> they seem to pierce the sky itself.<break time="3.5s"/>

Dappled sunlight filters through the canopy...<break time="2.5s"/> painting the forest floor...<break time="2s"/> in patterns of gold and emerald green.<break time="3s"/>

The air is cool here...<break time="2s"/> fragrant with resin and earth...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can taste...<break time="1.5s"/> the sweetness of growth...<break time="2s"/> the richness of life itself.<break time="3.5s"/>

At the center of the forest...<break time="2.5s"/> stands a tree unlike any other...<break time="2.5s"/> the World Tree...<break time="2s"/> axis mundi...<break time="2s"/> connecting earth to heaven.<break time="4s"/>

And beside this tree...<break time="2.5s"/> rooted as the tree itself...<break time="2s"/> stands The World Tree Guardian...<break time="2.5s"/> ancient beyond measure...<break time="2s"/> crowned with stars...<break time="2s"/> wrapped in roots and light.<break time="4s"/>

The Guardian's presence is vast...<break time="2.5s"/> but not overwhelming...<break time="2s"/> grounding...<break time="1.5s"/> but not heavy...<break time="2s"/> holding the balance...<break time="2s"/> between all things.<break time="3.5s"/>

The Guardian speaks...<break time="2.5s"/> and their voice...<break time="2s"/> is like the rustling of a thousand leaves...<break time="2.5s"/> like the creaking of ancient wood...<break time="2s"/> like the whisper of eternity.<break time="4s"/>

"You seek heroism,"<break time="2s"/> the Guardian says...<break time="2.5s"/> "but true heroism...<break time="2s"/> is not conquest...<break time="2s"/> it is connection.<break time="3s"/>

The Guardian invites you closer...<break time="2.5s"/> to place your hands...<break time="2s"/> upon the bark of the World Tree.<break time="3.5s"/>

As you do...<break time="2.5s"/> you feel a pulse...<break time="2s"/> not just in the tree...<break time="1.5s"/> but in your own body...<break time="2.5s"/> the same pulse...<break time="2s"/> the same heartbeat...<break time="2.5s"/> connecting you to everything.<break time="4.5s"/>

You are not separate.<break time="2.5s"/> You have never been separate.<break time="3s"/> You are a branch...<break time="2s"/> on the infinite tree...<break time="2s"/> of existence itself.<break time="4.5s"/>

She invites you to cup your hands...<break time="2.5s"/> and she pours the rose petals...<break time="2s"/> into your palms.<break time="3s"/>
