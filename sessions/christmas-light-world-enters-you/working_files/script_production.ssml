Let your shoulders drop away from your ears.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Let your jaw soften, allowing your teeth to part slightly.

Allow your eyes to close now.
<break time="2s"/>

Take a deep, slow breath in through your nose.
<break time="3s"/>
And release it gently through your mouth.
<break time="4s"/>

Another breath in, filling your lungs completely.
<break time="3s"/>
And let it go, releasing any tension you have been carrying.
<break time="4s"/>

One more breath, deeper still.

Now imagine that above you, far above you, the sky is darkening.
<break time="2s"/>
The last rays of daylight are fading.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Stars are beginning to appear, one by one.
<break time="2.5s"/>

And as the light fades from the sky, you begin a gentle descent.
<break time="2s"/>
Drifting down.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Floating down.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Deeper and deeper into a sacred, ancient darkness.
<break time="5s"/>

Ten.

Drifting deeper now.
<break time="1.5s"/>

Nine.

Four.

Three.

Two.
<break time="2s"/>
So deep, so peaceful.
<break time="1.5s"/>

One.
<break time="3s"/>

You have arrived.
<break time="4s"/>

You find yourself in the most profound silence you have ever known.
<break time="2.5s"/>

This is the ancient night before Christmas.
<break time="2s"/>
The holy hush of a world in waiting.
<break time="2s"/>
The sacred stillness before Emmanuel.
<break time="3s"/>

Feel the weight of Roman rule pressing heavily on daily life.
<break time="2s"/>
Generations have been praying for rescue and restoration.
<break time="2s"/>
Four hundred years of prophetic silence.
<break time="2s"/>
The ache of unanswered questions.
<break time="3s"/>

The earth holds its breath.
<break time="2s"/>
Silence felt not as emptiness, but as yearning.
<break time="3s"/>

And somewhere, whispered across time, an ancient promise stirs.

In this sacred darkness, you sense the ancient story of humanity.
<break time="2.5s"/>

There was a time of closeness.
<break time="1.5s"/>
A time when we walked with God in the cool of the day.
<break time="2s"/>
When intimacy was our inheritance.
<break time="2s"/>
When love was the air we breathed.

But something happened.
<break time="2s"/>
A turning.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Not marked by anger from above, but by fear and hiding below.
<break time="2.5s"/>

Separation began.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Felt as shame.
<break time="1.5s"/>
As exile.
<break time="1.5s"/>
As endless striving to earn what was always freely given.
<break time="3s"/>

Laws were given, pointing toward goodness but not healing the wound.
<break time="2s"/>
Sacrifices were offered, gesturing toward something deeper that was needed.
<break time="2s"/>
Prophets spoke of a promised one who would come.
<break time="2.5s"/>

And through it all, God pursued.
<break time="2s"/>
Never abandoning.
<break time="1.5s"/>
Always drawing near.

Always whispering: I am coming for you.

What feeling is ready to soften in you today?
<break time="4s"/>
Perhaps you do not need to name it.
<break time="2s"/>
Simply acknowledge that it exists.
<break time="3s"/>

Your own longing for wholeness.
<break time="2s"/>
Your own sense of incompleteness.
<break time="2s"/>
Your own waiting for something that would finally heal.

Not blinding.

Not overwhelming.

Aware of what you carry.

It does not rush.

It does not demand.

It simply waits with infinite patience.
<break time="3s"/>

The darkness around it begins to soften.

Not disappearing, but yielding.

Making space for what is coming.
