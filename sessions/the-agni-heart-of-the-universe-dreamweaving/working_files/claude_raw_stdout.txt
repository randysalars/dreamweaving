notice a presence...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nA luminous figure...<break time=\"2s\"/> robed in soft green light...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> eyes full of ancient compassion.<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nThis is

it...<break time=\"2s\"/> is alchemized...<break time=\"2s\"/> transmuted...<break time=\"2s\"/> returned as light.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nSo you bring to mind now...<break time=\"2s\"/> gently...<break time=\"2s\"/> something you are ready to release.<break time=\"3s\"/> Perhaps an old wound...<break time=\"2s\"/> a limiting belief...<break time=\"2s\"/> a pattern that has held you

fire receives it...<break time=\"2s\"/> and blazes brighter for a moment...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and you feel...<break time=\"2s\"/> lighter.<break time=\"3s\"/> Freer.<break time=\"2s\"/> More yourself.<break time=\"5s\"/>\n\nThe Inner Healer smiles...<break time=\"2s\"/> and steps aside...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> revealing another presence...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nA vast, towering figure...<break time=\"2s\"/> ancient as mountains...<break time=\"2s\"/> rooted and strong.<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nThe World Tree Guardian.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nThis presence is neither male nor

supported.<break time=\"2s\"/> You belong here.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe fire pulses brighter still...<break time=\"2s\"/> and from within its heart...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> a third presence emerges.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nRadiant and gentle...<break time=\"2s\"/> wreathed in roses of every color...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> red and white and gold and pink.<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nThe Rose

time=\"2s\"/> the fragrance of pure love.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nShe reaches out...<break time=\"2s\"/> and places one hand over your heart...<break time=\"3s\"/> and you feel...<break time=\"2s\"/> warmth blooming there...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> as though a rose were opening...<break time=\"2s\"/> petal by petal...<break time=\"2s\"/> in the center of your chest.<break time=\"5s\"/>\n\n\"You are

your hands.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThis is your sacred anchor...<break time=\"2s\"/> a reminder of this journey...<break time=\"2s\"/> and of the fire that burns within you...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> always.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe Inner Healer...<break time=\"2s\"/> the World Tree Guardian...<break time=\"2s\"/> and the Rose Mother...<break time=\"2s\"/> each place a hand upon you...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> blessing you.<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nAnd you know...<break time=\"2s\"/> that they are not separate from you...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> but aspects of your own deepest self...<break time=\"2s\"/> always present...<break time=\"2s\"/> always available.<break time=\"5s\"/>\n\nThe fire blazes bright one final time...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and its light fills you...<break
