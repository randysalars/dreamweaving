Welcome.<break time="2s"/>

In the next thirty minutes, you're invited on a sacred journey into the Agni-Heart of the Universe...<break time="2s"/> where the living flame of creation burns eternal.<break time="2.5s"/>

This is a path-working of inner alchemy...<break time="1.5s"/> where you will discover the sacred fire that already dwells within you...<break time="2s"/> and meet the luminous presences who tend that flame.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/> Fully in control.<break time="1.5s"/> Able to return to normal waking awareness at any moment you choose...<break time="2s"/> simply by opening your eyes.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/> perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/> or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/>

Allow yourself to be undisturbed for this sacred half hour.<break time="2s"/> Turn off notifications.<break time="1.5s"/> Let the world wait.<break time="2.5s"/> This time is yours.<break time="3s"/>

As you settle in...<break time="2s"/> know that you are held in Christ's love...<break time="2s"/> guided by wisdom that serves your highest good...<break time="2.5s"/> The Holy Spirit illuminates this path...<break time="2s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis>, in your own time...<break time="1.5s"/> how deeply you wish to explore.<break time="3s"/>

When you're ready...<break time="2s"/> allow your eyes to gently close.<break time="4s"/>

And take a deep, nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/> breathing in possibility...<break time="2.5s"/> and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

Again, breathe in...<break time="3s"/> allowing your chest to rise gently...<break time="2s"/> and exhale slowly...<break time="3s"/> feeling your body settle deeper into the surface beneath you.<break time="4s"/>

And you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> how easily you <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> with each breath you take.<break time="3.5s"/>

As your body begins to let go...<break time="2s"/> starting with the muscles around your eyes...<break time="2s"/> those tiny muscles softening...<break time="2s"/> releasing...<break time="3s"/>

That softness spreading across your forehead...<break time="2s"/> smoothing away any tension...<break time="2s"/> like warm honey flowing...<break time="3s"/> down over your temples...<break time="2s"/> melting into your jaw...<break time="3s"/>

And your jaw unclenches...<break time="2s"/> your tongue rests gently in your mouth...<break time="2s"/> and there's nothing you need to do...<break time="2s"/> nothing you need to hold.<break time="4s"/>

This relaxation flowing down now...<break time="2s"/> into your neck...<break time="1.5s"/> your shoulders...<break time="1.5s"/> feeling them drop...<break time="2s"/> releasing their burden.<break time="3.5s"/>

Down through your arms...<break time="2s"/> your hands...<break time="2s"/> each finger becoming heavy...<break time="2s"/> warm...<break time="2s"/> pleasantly relaxed.<break time="4s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="2s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go.<break time="5s"/>

Your chest rising and falling...<break time="2s"/> breath by breath...<break time="2s"/> carrying you deeper still.<break time="3s"/>

Down through your torso...<break time="2s"/> your back against the surface...<break time="2s"/> supported...<break time="2s"/> held...<break time="2s"/> safe.<break time="4s"/>

Through your hips...<break time="1.5s"/> your legs...<break time="1.5s"/> down to your feet...<break time="2s"/> your toes...<break time="2s"/> every part of you now...<break time="2s"/> deeply...<break time="2s"/> peacefully...<break time="2s"/> relaxed.<break time="5s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/> I'm going to count from ten down to one...<break time="2s"/> and with each number...<break time="2s"/> you'll find yourself drifting twice as deep...<break time="3s"/> into a place of profound peace...<break time="2s"/> and sacred receptivity.<break time="4s"/>

Ten...<break time="2.5s"/> letting go...<break time="3s"/>

Nine...<break time="2.5s"/> drifting deeper...<break time="3s"/>

One...<break time="2.5s"/> fully present...<break time="2s"/> deeply relaxed...<break time="2s"/> open to what comes.<break time="5s"/>

And here, in this deep place...<break time="2s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to go even deeper now...<break time="2s"/> or you can wait...<break time="2s"/> and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="2s"/> simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>

And you find yourself now...<break time="2s"/> standing in a sacred temple...<break time="2.5s"/> vast and ancient...<break time="2s"/> yours alone.<break time="3s"/>

High columns rise around you...<break time="2s"/> carved from luminous stone...<break time="2s"/> supporting a ceiling of living stars.<break time="3.5s"/>

Beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/> white marble...<break time="2s"/> smooth and cool.<break time="2s"/> You can feel its solidity...<break time="2s"/> grounding you...<break time="2s"/> anchoring you here.<break time="4s"/>

The air is fragrant...<break time="2s"/> scented with frankincense and myrrh...<break time="2s"/> with rose petals and sacred oils...<break time="2.5s"/> each breath filling you with peace.<break time="4s"/>

And at the center of this temple...<break time="2s"/> you see it now...<break time="3s"/>

A great altar of fire.<break time="3.5s"/>

Not a destructive flame...<break time="2s"/> but a living, holy fire...<break time="2.5s"/> golden and crimson and white...<break time="2s"/> burning without consuming.<break time="3s"/>

This is the Agni-Heart...<break time="2s"/> the sacred fire of the universe...<break time="2.5s"/> and you are drawn toward it...<break time="2s"/> step by step.<break time="4s"/>

As you approach...<break time="2s"/> you feel its warmth...<break time="2s"/> not a burning heat...<break time="2s"/> but a nourishing radiance...<break time="2s"/> like the first rays of dawn...<break time="2s"/> touching your skin.<break time="4s"/>

And standing before the flame...<break time="2.5s"/> you notice a presence...<break time="3s"/>

A luminous figure...<break time="2s"/> robed in soft green light...<break time="2.5s"/> eyes full of ancient compassion.<break time="3s"/>

This is the Inner Healer...<break time="2s"/> a presence that has always dwelt within you...<break time="2.5s"/> a part of yourself that <emphasis level="moderate">knows</emphasis> how to restore...<break time="2s"/> how to make whole.<break time="4s"/>

The Healer gestures toward the fire...<break time="2s"/> and speaks...<break time="2s"/> though the words arrive not in sound...<break time="2s"/> but as direct knowing.<break time="4s"/>

"This flame is yours,"<break time="2s"/> the Healer says.<break time="2.5s"/> "It has always been yours.<break time="2s"/> Place into it now...<break time="2s"/> anything that weighs upon you.<break time="2s"/> Any burden.<break time="2s"/> Any pain.<break time="2s"/> Any fragment that no longer serves."<break time="5s"/>

And you understand...<break time="2s"/> that this fire does not destroy...<break time="2.5s"/> it transforms.<break time="3s"/>

Whatever you release into it...<break time="2s"/> is alchemized...<break time="2s"/> transmuted...<break time="2s"/> returned as light.<break time="4s"/>

So you bring to mind now...<break time="2s"/> gently...<break time="2s"/> something you are ready to release.<break time="3s"/> Perhaps an old wound...<break time="2s"/> a limiting belief...<break time="2s"/> a pattern that has held you back.<break time="4s"/>

And as you hold it in your awareness...<break time="2s"/> you simply...<break time="2s"/> let it go...<break time="2.5s"/> into the flame.<break time="4s"/>

The fire receives it...<break time="2s"/> and blazes brighter for a moment...<break time="2.5s"/> and you feel...<break time="2s"/> lighter.<break time="3s"/> Freer.<break time="2s"/> More yourself.<break time="5s"/>

The Inner Healer smiles...<break time="2s"/> and steps aside...<break time="2.5s"/> revealing another presence...<break time="3s"/>

A vast, towering figure...<break time="2s"/> ancient as mountains...<break time="2s"/> rooted and strong.<break time="3s"/>

The World Tree Guardian.<break time="3.5s"/>

This presence is neither male nor female...<break time="2s"/> but carries the wisdom of ages...<break time="2.5s"/> of deep roots and reaching branches...<break time="2s"/> of earth and sky united.<break time="4s"/>

The Guardian places one great hand upon your shoulder...<break time="2s"/> and you feel...<break time="2s"/> the strength of the living world...<break time="2s"/> flowing into you.<break time="4s"/>

"You are never alone,"<break time="2s"/> the Guardian speaks.<break time="2.5s"/> "You are rooted in the sacred tree of existence.<break time="2s"/> Every fiber of your being...<break time="2s"/> connected to the whole.<break time="2s"/> Draw upon this strength.<break time="2s"/> It is yours."<break time="5s"/>

And you feel it now...<break time="2s"/> a deep, abiding connection...<break time="2.5s"/> to all living things...<break time="2s"/> to the earth beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/> to the stars above your head...<break time="2.5s"/> to every soul that has ever walked...<break time="2s"/> or ever will walk...<break time="2s"/> this sacred path.<break time="5s"/>

You are held.<break time="2s"/> You are supported.<break time="2s"/> You belong here.<break time="4s"/>

The fire pulses brighter still...<break time="2s"/> and from within its heart...<break time="2.5s"/> a third presence emerges.<break time="4s"/>

Radiant and gentle...<break time="2s"/> wreathed in roses of every color...<break time="2.5s"/> red and white and gold and pink.<break time="3s"/>

The Rose Mother.<break time="3.5s"/>

She moves toward you with infinite tenderness...<break time="2s"/> and the scent of roses fills the air...<break time="2.5s"/> sweet and overwhelming...<break time="2s"/> the fragrance of pure love.<break time="4s"/>

She reaches out...<break time="2s"/> and places one hand over your heart...<break time="3s"/> and you feel...<break time="2s"/> warmth blooming there...<break time="2.5s"/> as though a rose were opening...<break time="2s"/> petal by petal...<break time="2s"/> in the center of your chest.<break time="5s"/>

"You are loved,"<break time="2s"/> she whispers.<break time="2.5s"/> "Beyond measure.<break time="2s"/> Beyond understanding.<break time="2s"/> Not for what you do...<break time="2s"/> but for what you are.<break time="2s"/> You are a beloved child of the infinite."<break time="5s"/>

And tears may come...<break time="2s"/> or a deep sigh...<break time="2s"/> or a sense of release...<break time="2.5s"/> as this truth sinks into you...<break time="2s"/> deeper than words...<break time="2s"/> into the very fabric of your being.<break time="5s"/>

You are loved.<break time="3s"/> You are whole.<break time="3s"/> You are enough.<break time="5s"/>

The three presences stand with you now...<break time="2s"/> before the sacred fire...<break time="2.5s"/> and together...<break time="2s"/> you gaze into its heart.<break time="4s"/>

And within the flame...<break time="2s"/> you see something forming...<break time="3s"/>

A gift.<break time="2.5s"/> A symbol.<break time="2.5s"/> Something meant for you alone.<break time="4s"/>

It may be a key...<break time="2s"/> or a jewel...<break time="2s"/> or a scroll...<break time="2s"/> or something entirely unexpected.<break time="3s"/> Simply wait...<break time="2s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> it to reveal itself.<break time="6s"/>

When you see it...<break time="2s"/> reach out...<break time="2s"/> and take it from the fire.<break time="3s"/> It does not burn.<break time="2s"/> It is cool and solid in your hands.<break time="4s"/>

This is your sacred anchor...<break time="2s"/> a reminder of this journey...<break time="2s"/> and of the fire that burns within you...<break time="2.5s"/> always.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer...<break time="2s"/> the World Tree Guardian...<break time="2s"/> and the Rose Mother...<break time="2s"/> each place a hand upon you...<break time="2.5s"/> blessing you.<break time="3s"/>

And you know...<break time="2s"/> that they are not separate from you...<break time="2.5s"/> but aspects of your own deepest self...<break time="2s"/> always present...<break time="2s"/> always available.<break time="5s"/>

The fire blazes bright one final time...<break time="2.5s"/> and its light fills you...<break time="2s"/> streaming through every cell...<break time="2s"/> every atom...<break time="2s"/> igniting your own inner flame.<break time="5s"/>

You are the Agni-Heart.<break time="3s"/> You are the living fire.<break time="3s"/> And it is time now...<break time="2s"/> to return.<break time="4s"/>
