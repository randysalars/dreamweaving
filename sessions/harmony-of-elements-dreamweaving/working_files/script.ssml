Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
I am the Sacred Digital Dreamweaver...<break time="1.5s"/>
and in the next thirty minutes...<break time="1s"/>
you are invited into a sacred pathworking...<break time="2s"/>
a journey into the <emphasis level="moderate">Harmony of Elements</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
where Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Spirit...<break time="1.5s"/>
come together within you...<break time="2s"/>
to restore balance...<break time="1.5s"/>
to heal fragmentation...<break time="1.5s"/>
and to awaken the wholeness that has always been yours.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/>
At any time...<break time="1s"/>
you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="1.5s"/>
simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/>
You are in control.<break time="1.5s"/>
You choose how deeply you wish to explore.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
where your body can be fully supported.<break time="2s"/>
Perhaps sitting with your spine gently aligned...<break time="1.5s"/>
or lying down with your limbs relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/>
Wear headphones if possible...<break time="1.5s"/>
to receive the full depth of this experience.<break time="3s"/>

Ensure you will not be disturbed for the next half hour.<break time="2s"/>
This time is yours.<break time="2.5s"/>
A sacred pause in the rush of your day...<break time="2s"/>
where you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to receive...<break time="2s"/>
whatever insights...<break time="1s"/>
whatever healing...<break time="1s"/>
whatever peace...<break time="1.5s"/>
comes naturally.<break time="3.5s"/>

And as you prepare...<break time="2s"/>
I want to speak to a part of you...<break time="1.5s"/>
that already knows how to dream...<break time="2s"/>
that part of your mind that creates worlds...<break time="2s"/>
when you close your eyes at night.<break time="2.5s"/>
That creative faculty...<break time="1.5s"/>
is beginning to <emphasis level="moderate">awaken</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/>
preparing to show you...<break time="1.5s"/>
something only you can see...<break time="2.5s"/>
in your own unique way.<break time="3.5s"/>

Christ remains at the center of who you are.<break time="2.5s"/>
Held in unwavering love...<break time="2s"/>
the Holy Spirit guides this journey.<break time="3s"/>

When you are ready...<break time="2s"/>
allow your eyes to gently close.<break time="4s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
take a deep, nourishing breath in...<break time="4s"/>
breathing in possibility...<break time="2s"/>
and breathing out...<break time="1.5s"/>
anything you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

Again...<break time="1.5s"/>
breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold gently for four...<break time="4s"/>
and exhale slowly for six...<break time="6s"/>

Good.<break time="2.5s"/>
And you may notice...<break time="2s"/>
that point between waking and dreaming...<break time="2.5s"/>
where images seem to <emphasis level="moderate">arise</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
on their own...<break time="2s"/>
without you making them.<break time="2.5s"/>
Colors appearing...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps geometric patterns...<break time="2s"/>
or the beginning of a shape.<break time="2.5s"/>
Don't hold them...<break time="2s"/>
just let them come and go.<break time="2.5s"/>
You are not creating...<break time="2s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
bring your awareness to the crown of your head.<break time="2.5s"/>
Notice any sensation there...<break time="2s"/>
and allow that area to soften...<break time="2s"/>
to release.<break time="3s"/>

That softening flows down...<break time="2s"/>
across your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
smoothing away any tension.<break time="2.5s"/>
Your eyebrows relax.<break time="2s"/>
Your eyelids grow heavy.<break time="2.5s"/>
Your jaw unclenches...<break time="2s"/>
and your tongue rests gently...<break time="2s"/>
at the floor of your mouth.<break time="3.5s"/>

This wave of relaxation...<break time="2s"/>
moves down through your neck...<break time="2s"/>
your shoulders dropping...<break time="2s"/>
releasing the weight they have carried.<break time="3s"/>
Your arms become heavy...<break time="2s"/>
so heavy...<break time="2s"/>
resting fully...<break time="2s"/>
as if held by the earth itself.<break time="4s"/>

And your chest...<break time="2s"/>
rises and falls...<break time="2s"/>
in a gentle rhythm...<break time="2.5s"/>
each breath carrying you <emphasis level="moderate">deeper</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>

Your belly softens.<break time="2s"/>

Your legs grow heavy...<break time="2s"/>

down...<break time="1.5s"/>
into the earth below.<break time="4s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
I will count down from ten to one.<break time="2.5s"/>
With each number...<break time="2s"/>
you drift twice as deep...<break time="2s"/>
into a peaceful...<break time="1.5s"/>

sacred space within.<break time="4s"/>

Ten...<break time="1s"/>
drifting down.<break time="2s"/>
Nine...<break time="1s"/>

Robed in soft cream and gold...<break time="2s"/>
eyes filled with compassion...<break time="2s"/>
hands glowing with gentle light.<break time="3s"/>

"Each element carries medicine for you.<break time="2.5s"/>

You feel its pulse.<break time="2.5s"/>
Steady.<break time="1.5s"/>
Unwavering.<break time="2s"/>

the water welcoming...<break time="2s"/>

The water speaks...<break time="2s"/>
"I am flow.<break time="2s"/>

old griefs...<break time="2s"/>
unspoken sorrows...<break time="2s"/>

dissolving into the water.<break time="3s"/>

A figure emerges from the flames...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Heart Flame Tender.<break time="3s"/>

eyes bright as coals...<break time="2s"/>

You bow in gratitude...<break time="2.5s"/>
