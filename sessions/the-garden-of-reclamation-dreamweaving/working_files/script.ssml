Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
I am here to guide you on a sacred journey...<break time="1.5s"/>
a path-working into the Garden of Reclamation...<break time="2s"/>
where what was lost...<break time="1s"/>
can be found again.<break time="3s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="1s"/>
you will be invited to descend into a place of deep healing...<break time="2s"/>
a sanctuary where the Inner Healer awaits...<break time="1.5s"/>
where the Heart Flame Tender keeps vigil...<break time="1.5s"/>
and where the Rose Mother embraces all that you have left behind.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/>
You remain fully aware and in control.<break time="2s"/>
At any time...<break time="1s"/>
you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="1.5s"/>
simply by opening your eyes.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
where your body can be fully supported.<break time="2s"/>
Allow your spine to lengthen gently...<break time="1.5s"/>
your shoulders to soften...<break time="1.5s"/>
your hands to rest easily.<break time="3s"/>

When you are ready...<break time="1.5s"/>
allow your eyes to close...<break time="2s"/>
and take a deep...<break time="1s"/>
nourishing breath.<break time="3s"/>

Breathe in...<break time="1s"/>
through your nose...<break time="1s"/>
for a count of four.<break time="4s"/>

Hold gently.<break time="4s"/>

And exhale...<break time="1s"/>
slowly...<break time="1s"/>
for a count of six.<break time="6s"/>

Beautiful.<break time="2s"/>

Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time="2s"/>
held in unwavering love...<break time="2s"/>
as you choose...<break time="1s"/>
in your own time...<break time="1s"/>
to go deeper into this sacred space.<break time="3s"/>

And as you settle here...<break time="2s"/>
you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="1.5s"/>
how easily your body knows...<break time="1.5s"/>
how to <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>.<break time="3s"/>

Starting now at the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/>
you feel a gentle warmth...<break time="1.5s"/>
like golden sunlight...<break time="1.5s"/>
beginning to soften every muscle...<break time="2s"/>
every fiber...<break time="2s"/>
every cell.<break time="3s"/>

This warmth flows down...<break time="1.5s"/>
across your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
smoothing away any tension.<break time="2s"/>
Your eyes grow heavy...<break time="1.5s"/>
so pleasantly heavy...<break time="2s"/>
as the warmth melts around your temples...<break time="2s"/>
your jaw...<break time="1.5s"/>
your neck.<break time="3s"/>

Breathe in for four.<break time="4s"/>
Hold.<break time="4s"/>
Exhale for six.<break time="6s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go.<break time="4s"/>

The golden warmth flows down now...<break time="2s"/>
into your shoulders...<break time="1.5s"/>
feel them dropping...<break time="1.5s"/>
releasing...<break time="2s"/>
all the way down your arms...<break time="2s"/>
into your hands...<break time="1.5s"/>
your fingers...<break time="2s"/>
so deeply relaxed.<break time="3s"/>

Down into your chest now...<break time="2s"/>
feel your heart beating...<break time="1.5s"/>
steady...<break time="1s"/>
calm...<break time="1.5s"/>
held by something greater than yourself.<break time="3s"/>

The warmth continues...<break time="1.5s"/>
down through your belly...<break time="1.5s"/>
your hips...<break time="1.5s"/>
your thighs...<break time="2s"/>
all the way to your feet...<break time="2s"/>
grounding you...<break time="1.5s"/>
connecting you to the earth beneath.<break time="4s"/>

And now I will count down from ten to one...<break time="2s"/>
and with each number...<break time="1.5s"/>
you drift deeper...<break time="1.5s"/>
more peaceful...<break time="1.5s"/>
more open.<break time="3s"/>

Ten...<break time="1s"/>
letting go.<break time="2s"/>
Nine...<break time="1s"/>
sinking deeper.<break time="2s"/>
Eight...<break time="1s"/>
so very calm.<break time="2s"/>
Seven...<break time="1s"/>
releasing all effort.<break time="2s"/>
Six...<break time="1s"/>
halfway there now.<break time="2s"/>
Five...<break time="1s"/>
deeper still.<break time="2s"/>
Four...<break time="1s"/>
safe and held.<break time="2s"/>
Three...<break time="1s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now...<break time="2s"/>
you find yourself standing...<break time="1.5s"/>
at the edge of a garden.<break time="3s"/>

Not just any garden...<break time="2s"/>
but the Garden of Reclamation...<break time="2s"/>
a sacred space...<break time="1.5s"/>
where all that has been lost...<break time="1.5s"/>
abandoned...<break time="1.5s"/>
forgotten...<break time="2s"/>
waits patiently to be found again.<break time="4s"/>

Before you stands a wooden gate...<break time="2s"/>
weathered and beautiful...<break time="1.5s"/>
carved with roses in full bloom.<break time="2s"/>
You reach out...<break time="1.5s"/>
and your hand touches the warm wood...<break time="2s"/>
feeling the grooves beneath your fingertips.<break time="3s"/>

The gate swings open...<break time="1.5s"/>
with a soft creak...<break time="1.5s"/>
and you step through.<break time="3s"/>

</prosody>

[SFX: Wooden gate creaking open gently, 2s duration with settling]

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">

The air here is different...<break time="2s"/>
soft and golden...<break time="1.5s"/>
like late afternoon sunlight filtering through leaves.<break time="2s"/>
You smell earth...<break time="1.5s"/>
rich and dark...<break time="1.5s"/>
mixed with the sweetness of roses...<break time="1.5s"/>
and something else...<break time="1.5s"/>
honey...<break time="1s"/>
warm bread...<break time="1.5s"/>
the scent of home.<break time="4s"/>

As you walk forward...<break time="2s"/>
along a path of moss-covered stones...<break time="2s"/>
you notice the garden is wild...<break time="1.5s"/>
but not chaotic.<break time="2s"/>
It grows according to its own wisdom...<break time="2s"/>
roses climbing over ancient walls...<break time="2s"/>
ivy draping gently from oak trees...<break time="2s"/>
wildflowers blooming in clusters of violet...<break time="1.5s"/>
gold...<break time="1s"/>
and white.<break time="4s"/>

And there...<break time="1.5s"/>
ahead of you...<break time="1.5s"/>
you see a figure.<break time="3s"/>

This is the Inner Healer...<break time="2s"/>
a radiant presence...<break time="1.5s"/>
clothed in robes of soft green and gold.<break time="2s"/>
Their face is kind...<break time="1.5s"/>
their eyes deep with compassion...<break time="2s"/>
and as they meet your gaze...<break time="1.5s"/>
you feel seen...<break time="1.5s"/>
truly seen...<break time="1.5s"/>
for the first time in a long while.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer gestures for you to follow...<break time="2s"/>
and you walk together...<break time="1.5s"/>
deeper into the garden.<break time="3s"/>

You pass beds of herbs...<break time="1.5s"/>
lavender...<break time="1s"/>
rosemary...<break time="1s"/>
thyme...<break time="1.5s"/>
each releasing its fragrance as you brush past.<break time="2s"/>
The sound of water...<break time="1.5s"/>
gentle and constant...<break time="1.5s"/>
grows louder ahead.<break time="3s"/>

And then you see it.<break time="2s"/>
At the heart of the garden...<break time="2s"/>
a stone fountain...<break time="1.5s"/>
ancient and moss-covered...<break time="2s"/>
water flowing from the open hands...<break time="1.5s"/>
of a carved figure.<break time="3s"/>

This is the Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2s"/>
whose hands have held the eternal flame...<break time="2s"/>
the light that never goes out...<break time="1.5s"/>
even in the darkest night.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer invites you to sit...<break time="2s"/>
on the edge of the fountain...<break time="1.5s"/>
and you lower yourself down...<break time="1.5s"/>
feeling the cool stone beneath you.<break time="3s"/>

<emphasis level="moderate">Rest</emphasis> here...<break time="2s"/>
the Healer whispers.<break time="2s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">Allow</emphasis> yourself to receive.<break time="4s"/>

And as you sit...<break time="2s"/>
you begin to notice something appearing...<break time="1.5s"/>
in the water before you.<break time="3s"/>

Images...<break time="1.5s"/>
fragments...<break time="1.5s"/>
pieces of yourself you left behind.<break time="4s"/>

A younger you...<break time="1.5s"/>
full of hope...<break time="1.5s"/>
before the world grew heavy.<break time="3s"/>

A dream you set aside.<break time="2s"/>
A joy you stopped allowing.<break time="2s"/>
A part of your heart...<break time="1.5s"/>
you closed off...<break time="1.5s"/>
to survive.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer places a gentle hand on your shoulder.<break time="3s"/>
These are not lost...<break time="2s"/>
they say softly.<break time="2s"/>
They have been waiting here...<break time="1.5s"/>
in the Garden of Reclamation.<break time="4s"/>

[SFX: Crystalline water droplets, shimmering tones, 5s with gentle reverb]

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">

And now...<break time="2s"/>
a third presence joins you.<break time="3s"/>

The Rose Mother.<break time="3s"/>

She emerges from between the climbing roses...<break time="2s"/>
her form soft and powerful at once...<break time="2s"/>
her presence like warm earth and blooming petals.<break time="2s"/>
She carries in her arms...<break time="1.5s"/>
a basket woven of willow.<break time="3s"/>

One by one...<break time="2s"/>
she reaches into the water...<break time="1.5s"/>
and gathers the fragments you see there.<break time="2s"/>
The younger you...<break time="1.5s"/>
the forgotten dream...<break time="1.5s"/>
the closed-off joy...<break time="2s"/>
each one lifted gently...<break time="1.5s"/>
with reverence...<break time="1.5s"/>
and placed in her basket.<break time="4s"/>

She turns to you...<break time="2s"/>
and her eyes hold infinite tenderness.<break time="3s"/>

These belong to you...<break time="2s"/>
she says.<break time="2s"/>
You may <emphasis level="moderate">reclaim</emphasis> them now.<break time="4s"/>

And she offers the basket to you.<break time="3s"/>

You reach in...<break time="2s"/>
and as your hands touch each fragment...<break time="2s"/>
you feel it return to you.<break time="2s"/>
Not as it was...<break time="1.5s"/>
but transformed...<break time="1.5s"/>
wiser...<break time="1.5s"/>
softer...<break time="1.5s"/>
stronger.<break time="4s"/>

The hope returns...<break time="1.5s"/>
but now it is tempered with compassion.<break time="3s"/>
The dream returns...<break time="1.5s"/>
but now it is rooted in wisdom.<break time="3s"/>
The joy returns...<break time="1.5s"/>
but now it knows how to hold sorrow too.<break time="4s"/>

With each piece you reclaim...<break time="2s"/>
you feel warmth spreading through your chest...<break time="2s"/>
a gentle glow...<break time="1.5s"/>
the Heart Flame rekindling.<break time="3s"/>

The Rose Mother smiles.<break time="2s"/>
The Inner Healer stands beside you.<break time="2s"/>
The Heart Flame Tender's hands continue to pour forth living water.<break time="4s"/>

And you sit here...<break time="2s"/>
in this sacred garden...<break time="2s"/>
whole again.<break time="3s"/>
Not because nothing was lost...<break time="2s"/>
but because what was lost...<break time="1.5s"/>
has been found.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother speaks once more.<break time="3s"/>
Whenever you need to return...<break time="2s"/>
this garden is here.<break time="2s"/>
The gate is always open.<break time="2s"/>
We are always waiting.<break time="4s"/>

You <emphasis level="moderate">breathe</emphasis> in the fragrance of roses.<break time="3s"/>
You <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> the warmth of the sun on your skin.<break time="3s"/>
You <emphasis level="moderate">hear</emphasis> the water flowing...<break time="2s"/>
constant...<break time="1.5s"/>
eternal.<break time="4s"/>

And you know...<break time="2s"/>
deep in your bones...<break time="2s"/>
that you are held.<break time="3s"/>
You are seen.<break time="2s"/>
You are whole.<break time="4s"/>
