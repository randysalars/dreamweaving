Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
In the next thirty minutes, you are invited on a transformational journey to the Mountain of Resolve...<break time="2.5s"/>
a sacred inner landscape where your deepest strength awakens...<break time="2s"/>
where scattered intentions crystallize into unshakable will...<break time="2.5s"/>
and where you discover the quiet fire that lives at the center of your being.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience...<break time="2s"/>
fully in control...<break time="1.5s"/>
able to return to normal waking awareness at any moment simply by opening your eyes.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/>
or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/>
Allow your eyes to close when you feel ready...<break time="2s"/>
and take a deep, nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/>
breathing in possibility...<break time="2s"/>
and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="3.5s"/>

This journey is held in Christ's unwavering love...<break time="2s"/>
guided by wisdom that serves your highest good...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Holy Spirit illuminates this path...<break time="2s"/>
and you <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis>, in your own time...<break time="1.5s"/>
how deeply you wish to explore.<break time="4s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And as you settle here...<break time="2s"/>
begin to notice your breathing...<break time="2.5s"/>
not changing it...<break time="1.5s"/>
simply observing the natural rhythm...<break time="2.5s"/>
the gentle rise and fall of your chest...<break time="3s"/>
the soft whisper of air moving in...<break time="2s"/>
and out.<break time="3.5s"/>

Breathe in deeply for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold gently for four...<break time="4s"/>
and exhale slowly for six...<break time="6s"/>
Again, breathing in...<break time="4s"/>
holding...<break time="4s"/>
and releasing completely.<break time="6s"/>

And with each breath...<break time="2s"/>
you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
how easily your body knows how to <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
starting with the muscles around your eyes...<break time="2s"/>
softening...<break time="2s"/>
releasing...<break time="3s"/>
that softness spreading across your forehead...<break time="2.5s"/>
down through your jaw...<break time="2s"/>
your neck and shoulders melting...<break time="2.5s"/>
like warm honey...<break time="2s"/>
down your arms...<break time="2s"/>
through your fingertips.<break time="3.5s"/>

Your chest softens with each exhale...<break time="2.5s"/>
your belly rises and falls in its own perfect rhythm...<break time="3s"/>
and that wave of relaxation continues...<break time="2s"/>
down through your hips...<break time="2s"/>
your thighs...<break time="2s"/>
your calves...<break time="2s"/>
all the way to the soles of your feet.<break time="4s"/>

And the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="2s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
the deeper you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>
simply by listening...<break time="2s"/>
and breathing...<break time="2s"/>
and letting go.<break time="4.5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And now...<break time="2s"/>
imagine a staircase before you...<break time="2.5s"/>
ten steps descending...<break time="2s"/>
leading down to a place of deeper peace...<break time="2.5s"/>
deeper knowing...<break time="2s"/>
deeper strength.<break time="3.5s"/>

In a moment, we'll count down together...<break time="2s"/>
and with each number...<break time="1.5s"/>
you'll step down...<break time="1.5s"/>
and <emphasis level="moderate">drop</emphasis> twice as deep...<break time="3s"/>
twice as relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
twice as open to what waits below.<break time="4s"/>

Ten...<break time="1s"/>
stepping down now...<break time="2s"/>
feeling your body growing heavier...<break time="2.5s"/>
more grounded.<break time="3s"/>

Nine...<break time="1s"/>
descending further...<break time="2s"/>
letting go of the need to think...<break time="2.5s"/>
to analyze...<break time="2s"/>
to control.<break time="3.5s"/>

Eight...<break time="1s"/>
twice as deep...<break time="2s"/>
your awareness turning inward...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a spiral of light.<break time="3s"/>

Seven...<break time="1s"/>
dropping down...<break time="2s"/>
held in perfect safety...<break time="2.5s"/>
in Christ's embrace.<break time="3.5s"/>

Six...<break time="1s"/>
halfway there...<break time="2s"/>
and you may notice...<break time="1.5s"/>
how your mind begins to dream...<break time="2.5s"/>
images arising on their own.<break time="3.5s"/>

Five...<break time="1s"/>
deeper still...<break time="2s"/>
colors appearing...<break time="2s"/>
shapes forming...<break time="2.5s"/>
the threshold between waking and vision softening.<break time="4s"/>

Four...<break time="1s"/>
letting go...<break time="2s"/>
surrendering to this descent...<break time="2.5s"/>
trusting completely.<break time="3.5s"/>

Three...<break time="1s"/>
nearly there...<break time="2s"/>
your body so relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
your mind so open.<break time="3.5s"/>

Two...<break time="1s"/>
one more step...<break time="2s"/>
feeling the shift...<break time="2s"/>
into sacred space.<break time="4s"/>

And one...<break time="1.5s"/>
you have arrived...<break time="3s"/>
at the base of the Mountain of Resolve.<break time="5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And here you stand...<break time="2.5s"/>
at the foot of an immense mountain...<break time="2.5s"/>
rising before you into a sky of deep twilight blue.<break time="3s"/>

The air is crisp and clean...<break time="2s"/>
carrying the scent of cedar and stone...<break time="2.5s"/>
and something else...<break time="2s"/>
a faint sweetness...<break time="1.5s"/>
like wild roses blooming in unexpected places.<break time="3.5s"/>

The mountain is not steep...<break time="2s"/>
but steady...<break time="1.5s"/>
its path winding upward in gentle switchbacks...<break time="2.5s"/>
carved smooth by countless feet before you.<break time="3s"/>

You feel your body here...<break time="2s"/>
in this sacred inner landscape...<break time="2.5s"/>
your feet on solid ground...<break time="2s"/>
your heart beating strong and steady in your chest.<break time="3.5s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
a presence approaches...<break time="2.5s"/>
moving with quiet grace.<break time="3s"/>

It is the Inner Healer...<break time="2.5s"/>
a compassionate figure clothed in soft white...<break time="2.5s"/>
eyes radiating warmth and understanding...<break time="3s"/>
hands that have tended countless wounds...<break time="2.5s"/>
and know exactly where you need healing.<break time="4s"/>

The Healer extends a hand to you...<break time="2.5s"/>
and as you take it...<break time="2s"/>
you feel a gentle pulse of warmth...<break time="2s"/>
traveling up your arm...<break time="2s"/>
settling in your heart.<break time="3.5s"/>

"You are ready," the Healer says softly.<break time="2.5s"/>
"The mountain has been waiting for you."<break time="4s"/>

Together, you begin to climb...<break time="3s"/>
one step at a time...<break time="2s"/>
breathing with the rhythm of the ascent.<break time="3.5s"/>

And as you walk...<break time="2s"/>
you notice something remarkable...<break time="2.5s"/>
with each step upward...<break time="2s"/>
a scattered intention within you begins to <emphasis level="moderate">crystallize</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
fragmented desires aligning...<break time="2.5s"/>
into a single, clear direction.<break time="4s"/>

The path curves around an outcropping of rose-colored stone...<break time="2.5s"/>
and there...<break time="1.5s"/>
standing beside a cluster of wild roses growing impossibly from the rock...<break time="3s"/>
is the Rose Mother.<break time="3.5s"/>

Her presence is both fierce and tender...<break time="2.5s"/>
strength and softness woven together...<break time="2.5s"/>
thorns and petals in perfect balance.<break time="3.5s"/>

She reaches down and plucks a single rose...<break time="2.5s"/>
its petals the color of dawn...<break time="2s"/>
and places it in your hands.<break time="3s"/>

"This is your resolve," she whispers.<break time="2.5s"/>
"It has always been growing within you...<break time="2s"/>
even in the hardest soil...<break time="2s"/>
even when you could not see it."<break time="4s"/>

You hold the rose...<break time="2s"/>
feeling its weight...<break time="2s"/>
its reality...<break time="2s"/>
its undeniable truth.<break time="3.5s"/>

And you continue climbing...<break time="2.5s"/>
the Healer on one side...<break time="2s"/>
the Rose Mother on the other...<break time="2.5s"/>
their presence a steady comfort.<break time="4s"/>

The air grows thinner...<break time="2s"/>
but your breath deepens...<break time="2s"/>
your body adjusting...<break time="2s"/>
growing stronger with each step.<break time="3.5s"/>

Ahead, you see a warm golden glow...<break time="2.5s"/>
and as the path opens...<break time="2s"/>
you arrive at the summit.<break time="4s"/>

Here, at the peak of the Mountain of Resolve...<break time="2.5s"/>
stands a small temple of white stone...<break time="2.5s"/>
its entrance framed by two pillars...<break time="2.5s"/>
and at its center...<break time="2s"/>
a sacred flame burns.<break time="4s"/>

Tending this flame...<break time="2s"/>
is the Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2.5s"/>
a radiant figure robed in deep crimson and gold...<break time="3s"/>
eyes reflecting the eternal fire...<break time="2.5s"/>
hands moving with reverent care.<break time="3.5s"/>

"This is the fire of your will," the Tender says...<break time="2.5s"/>
"the flame that never goes out...<break time="2s"/>
even when you forget it is there."<break time="4s"/>

The Tender gestures for you to approach...<break time="2.5s"/>
and as you step closer...<break time="2s"/>
you feel the warmth of the flame on your face...<break time="2.5s"/>
its light illuminating everything within you.<break time="4s"/>

"Place the rose in the fire," the Tender invites.<break time="3s"/>

And you do...<break time="2s"/>
watching as the petals ignite...<break time="2.5s"/>
not burning away...<break time="2s"/>
but transforming...<break time="2.5s"/>
becoming light itself...<break time="3s"/>
merging with the eternal flame.<break time="4.5s"/>

And in that moment...<break time="2s"/>
you feel it...<break time="2s"/>
the fire awakening in your own heart...<break time="3s"/>
a warmth that spreads through your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
a <emphasis level="moderate">strength</emphasis> that rises from deep within...<break time="3s"/>
a clarity that burns away all doubt.<break time="4.5s"/>

You are <emphasis level="strong">resolve</emphasis> itself.<break time="3s"/>
You are the mountain.<break time="2.5s"/>
You are the flame.<break time="3s"/>
Unshakable...<break time="2s"/>
unwavering...<break time="2s"/>
whole.<break time="5s"/>

And now...<break time="2.5s"/>
the Flame Tender places a hand over your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
sealing this fire within you.<break time="3s"/>

"It goes with you," the Tender says.<break time="2.5s"/>
"Wherever you walk...<break time="2s"/>
this flame walks with you."<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother steps forward...<break time="2s"/>
and touches your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
and you feel the softness of petals...<break time="2s"/>
and the strength of thorns...<break time="2.5s"/>
both becoming part of you.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer embraces you gently...<break time="2.5s"/>
and whispers...<break time="2s"/>
"You are whole now...<break time="2s"/>
in ways you have never been before."<break time="4.5s"/>

And you begin to descend the mountain...<break time="2.5s"/>
step by step...<break time="2s"/>
carrying this strength...<break time="2s"/>
this clarity...<break time="2s"/>
this fire...<break time="2.5s"/>

the hours ahead...<break time="1.5s"/>
even the days ahead...<break time="2s"/>
insights continue to unfold...<break time="2.5s"/>
your mind gently reorganizing around what serves you most.<break time="4.5s"/>

Whenever you need to reconnect with this resolve...<break time="2.5s"/>
simply place your hand over your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
take three deep breaths...<break time="3s"/>
and feel the flame rekindling.<break time="4s"/>

When you recall the scent of wild roses...<break time="2.5s"/>
you will remember your own fierce tenderness...<break time="3s"/>
your capacity to bloom in impossible places.<break time="4.5s"/>

And when you feel warmth in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
you will know that your resolve is awakening...<break time="3s"/>
rising to meet whatever challenge stands before you.<break time="5s"/>
