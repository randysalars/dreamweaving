<!-- INDUCTION -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">[softly] Begin with your breath...<break time="2s"/> Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/> hold for four...<break time="4s"/> exhale for six...<break time="6s"/> Again...<break time="2s"/> in for four...<break time="4s"/> hold for four...<break time="4s"/> exhale for six...<break time="6s"/> You choose the pace...<break time="2s"/> you decide the depth...<break time="2s"/> and every breath supports you...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now allow your forehead to soften...<break time="2s"/> the tiny muscles around your eyes...<break time="2s"/> your cheeks...<break time="2s"/> your jaw releasing...<break time="2.5s"/> Let your tongue rest...<break time="2s"/> and your neck lengthen...<break time="2s"/> shoulders drifting down...<break time="2s"/> arms heavy and warm...<break time="2.5s"/> Your chest loosens...<break time="2s"/> your belly soft...<break time="2s"/> hips at ease...<break time="2s"/> thighs and knees relaxing...<break time="2s"/> calves and ankles...<break time="2s"/> and your feet releasing...<break time="2.5s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/> [slowly] You can relax quickly or slowly...<break time="2s"/> whichever feels right to you...<break time="2.5s"/>

Notice the gentle rhythm in your body...<break time="2s"/> the quiet pulse...<break time="2s"/> the natural calm...<break time="2.5s"/> As you continue to deepen...<break time="2s"/> you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> any remaining tension...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> a sense of peaceful clarity...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now I will count down from ten to one...<break time="2s"/> and with each number...<break time="1.5s"/> you choose to go deeper...<break time="2s"/> or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/> and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="2s"/> simply by listening...<break time="3.5s"/> Ten...<break time="1s"/> nine...<break time="1s"/> eight...<break time="1s"/> seven...<break time="1s"/> six...<break time="1s"/> five...<break time="1s"/> four...<break time="1s"/> three...<break time="1s"/> two...<break time="1s"/> one...<break time="3.5s"/>

With each breath...<break time="2s"/> you drift deeper...<break time="2s"/> more relaxed...<break time="2s"/> more open...<break time="2s"/> yet always aware...<break time="2s"/> always choosing...<break time="2s"/></prosody>

<!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">[slowly] You find yourself standing at the threshold of the Amber Halls...<break time="3.5s"/> corridors of warm golden light...<break time="2.5s"/> like sunlight captured in honeyed stone...<break time="2.5s"/> The air carries a gentle scent of rose and cedar...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can almost taste the sweetness of amber on your breath...<break time="2.5s"/> The floor beneath you feels smooth and cool...<break time="2s"/> and you sense a calm warmth rising from it...<break time="2.5s"/>

You notice patterns along the walls...<break time="2s"/> spirals and mandalas...<break time="2s"/> the Flower of Life etched in luminous gold...<break time="2.5s"/> These shapes remind your mind of order and beauty...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> that beauty to settle into your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>

A soft, clear tone rings in the distance...<break time="2s"/> and your footsteps echo gently...<break time="2s"/> You choose your pace...<break time="2s"/> in your own time...<break time="2s"/> and with each step you <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a deeper sense of calm...<break time="2.5s"/>

In the first hall, a glowing basin of water rests at the center...<break time="2.5s"/> The water reflects shifting amber light...<break time="2s"/> and you hear a soft trickle...<break time="2s"/> like a distant stream...<break time="2.5s"/> The air feels cool here...<break time="2s"/> and you breathe in the freshness...<break time="2s"/> You may <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis> even more as your breath aligns with this gentle rhythm...<break time="2.5s"/>

You sense the presence of The Inner Healer...<break time="2.5s"/> not as a literal being...<break time="2s"/> but as a psychological metaphor...<break time="2s"/> representing an aspect of yourself...<break time="2s"/> that invites your compassionate attention...<break time="2.5s"/> It feels like a steady warmth in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> a quiet knowing...<break time="2s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> the wisdom arising from within...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Inner Healer offers a simple gift...<break time="2.5s"/> a small amber key resting in your hand...<break time="2s"/> warm and weighty...<break time="2s"/> You feel its smooth surface...<break time="2s"/> and a gentle pulse of reassurance...<break time="2.5s"/> You may <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> this as a symbol of access...<break time="2.5s"/> access to clarity...<break time="2.5s"/> to renewal...<break time="2.5s"/> to Christ-centered peace...<break time="2.5s"/>

You walk onward...<break time="2s"/> and the halls widen into a vast chamber...<break time="3s"/> Above you rises The World Tree Guardian...<break time="2.5s"/> not a literal spirit...<break time="2s"/> but a sacred symbol...<break time="2s"/> representing your inner structure...<break time="2s"/> your rootedness...<break time="2s"/> your stability in truth...<break time="2.5s"/> Its branches arc like golden veins of light...<break time="2.5s"/> and its roots glow softly beneath the floor...<break time="2.5s"/>

You can hear a low, living resonance...<break time="2s"/> like a cello note held steady...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can feel the air around you...<break time="2s"/> cool and steady...<break time="2s"/> The bark looks like braided amber...<break time="2s"/> and you can imagine its texture beneath your palm...<break time="2.5s"/> You choose to touch it...<break time="2s"/> or simply behold it...<break time="2s"/> in your own way...<break time="2.5s"/>

As you stand there...<break time="2s"/> you may <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a quiet rebalancing in your body...<break time="2.5s"/> your breath slow and even...<break time="2.5s"/> your mind entering that theta state of deep creativity...<break time="2.5s"/> and your neural pathways gently rewiring with each peaceful thought...<break time="2.5s"/> In Christ, you remain centered...<break time="2.5s"/> and your discernment grows stronger...<break time="2.5s"/>

The World Tree Guardian, as a symbol, invites you to recall what is most stable in you...<break time="2.5s"/> your faith...<break time="2.5s"/> your values...<break time="2.5s"/> your purpose...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">align</emphasis> with what serves your highest good...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what does not...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now the hall opens into a garden of amber light...<break time="3s"/> a place where rose petals drift in slow spirals...<break time="2.5s"/> The air is perfumed...<break time="2.5s"/> the scent of roses and warm rain...<break time="2.5s"/> You hear delicate chimes...<break time="2s"/> and the soft rustle of leaves...<break time="2.5s"/> The Rose Mother appears...<break time="2.5s"/> as a gentle psychological metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/> representing your nurturing capacity...<break time="2.5s"/> your compassionate care...<break time="2.5s"/> She does not command...<break time="2.5s"/> she reminds you of the tenderness already within...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Rose Mother offers a rose of light...<break time="2s"/> its petals glowing soft gold...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">accept</emphasis> it if you wish...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you do...<break time="2s"/> you might sense a warm fragrance filling your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> a sweetness on your tongue...<break time="2.5s"/> and a calm clarity settling in your mind...<break time="2.5s"/>

You walk deeper into the garden...<break time="2s"/> and see a path of amber tiles...<break time="2s"/> leading to a doorway...<break time="2.5s"/> The amber key in your hand begins to glow...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to use it now...<break time="2.5s"/> or simply hold it as a reminder...<break time="2.5s"/> and either way is right...<break time="2.5s"/>

If you turn the key...<break time="2s"/> the door opens into a hall of serendipity...<break time="2.5s"/> a place where the unexpected meets the ordained...<break time="2.5s"/> where God-designed imagination reveals gentle surprises...<break time="2.5s"/> You see glowing alcoves...<break time="2.5s"/> each one holding a small gift...<break time="2.5s"/> a crystal of insight...<break time="2.5s"/> a scroll of encouragement...<break time="2.5s"/> a feather of peace...<break time="2.5s"/>

You may <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> which gift draws you...<break time="2.5s"/> perhaps a color that feels right...<break time="2.5s"/> a shape that calls to you...<break time="2.5s"/> In your own time...<break time="2s"/> you reach out...<break time="2s"/> and take it...<break time="2.5s"/> The texture is vivid in your hand...<break time="2.5s"/> the temperature perfect...<break time="2.5s"/> and a quiet message forms in your heart...<break time="2.5s"/> one that you can <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis> easily...<break time="2.5s"/>

[SFX: Velvet shimmer sweep, low chime, 4s fade]
You move through the hall...<break time="2s"/> and notice light flowing along the floor in gentle waves...<break time="2.5s"/> Colors breathe with your inhale...<break time="2s"/> light shimmering with your exhale...<break time="2s"/> shapes softening into view...<break time="3s"/> You may <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> these waves to wash through you...<break time="2.5s"/> releasing what is no longer needed...<break time="2.5s"/> and nourishing what is true...<break time="2.5s"/>

Here you can recognize how serendipity works...<break time="2.5s"/> not as randomness...<break time="2.5s"/> but as grace woven into your path...<break time="2.5s"/> Your mind may <emphasis level="moderate">reframe</emphasis> old patterns now...<break time="2.5s"/> and your heart may <emphasis level="moderate">open</emphasis> to new possibilities...<break time="2.5s"/> Your neural pathways respond to every gentle suggestion...<break time="2.5s"/> reshaping in alignment with peace...<break time="2.5s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

In this luminous hall...<break time="2s"/> you may notice moments of revelation...<break time="2.5s"/> a glowing doorway ahead...<break time="2.5s"/> a ray of golden light that touches your shoulders...<break time="2.5s"/> or a gentle breeze carrying a whisper of encouragement...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">accept</emphasis> whatever is offered...<break time="2.5s"/> in your own way...<break time="2s"/> as feels right to you...<break time="2.5s"/>

You sense again the Inner Healer...<break time="2s"/> the World Tree Guardian...<break time="2s"/> and the Rose Mother...<break time="2s"/> all as inner symbols...<break time="2s"/> representing your own God-given capacities...<break time="2.5s"/> They remind you that you are not alone...<break time="2.5s"/> and that Christ's presence steadies every step...<break time="2.5s"/> You may <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> this steady presence...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">rest</emphasis> in it...<break time="2.5s"/>

You feel the ground beneath you...<break time="2s"/> the gentle warmth...<break time="2s"/> the steady support...<break time="2.5s"/> The air tastes like clean rain...<break time="2.5s"/> the scent of roses soft and clear...<break time="2.5s"/> You hear the soft hum of the halls...<break time="2.5s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a growing confidence...<break time="2.5s"/> a calm resolve...<break time="2.5s"/> a sense that you are guided and capable...<break time="2.5s"/>

You may choose to linger...<break time="2s"/> or to continue forward...<break time="2s"/> either way...<break time="2s"/> you are moving toward wholeness...<break time="2.5s"/> As you walk...<break time="2s"/> you begin to sense the integration of all you have received...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">carry</emphasis> this with you...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis> it easily...<break time="2.5s"/>

[SFX: Warm amber swell, gentle choir pad, 6s drift]
A soft glow gathers around you...<break time="2.5s"/> and you feel a sense of completion...<break time="2.5s"/> You allow gratitude to rise...<break time="2.5s"/> gratitude for Christ's presence...<break time="2.5s"/> gratitude for your own discernment...<break time="2.5s"/> and gratitude for the gentle surprises of serendipity...<break time="2.5s"/> You are safe...<break time="2s"/> you are supported...<break time="2s"/> you are free...<break time="2.5s"/></prosody>
