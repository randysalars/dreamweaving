**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Match the Section Timing above within ±10%; expand MAIN JOURNEY and INTEGRATION first if you need more time.
2. Keep total length within 2193-2680 words to land near 30 minutes. If you are short, add sensory detail and deepen the MAIN JOURNEY; if long, trim gently.
3. Use rate="1.0" for ALL prosody tags (never use slow rates like 0.85)
4. Use <break time="Xs"/> tags liberally for hypnotic pacing, favoring slightly longer pauses: 2-3s for normal beats, 3-5s for deeper drops, 1s for countdown ticks
5. Include rich sensory language engaging all 5 senses
6. Embed hypnotic suggestions naturally throughout
7. Include 3-5 post-hypnotic anchors in the closing

**SFX MARKERS (REQUIRED):**
- Embed natural language SFX cues using [SFX: ...] (or [[SFX:...]]). Keep each marker concise (<140 chars) and place it exactly where the sound should trigger.
- Provide at least 5 markers covering the journey arc: opening/entry tone, induction ambience, deepening texture, main journey accent(s), and integration/return chime.
- Markers must describe sound character and duration (e.g., "Deep bronze bell, warm, 3s decay"), live on their own line, and avoid SSML tags inside the marker.
- Keep markers within the <speak> body; they'll be stripped for voice synthesis but used to render the SFX track.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Output ONLY the SSML script, starting with <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
Do NOT include any explanation or commentary before or after the SSML.
