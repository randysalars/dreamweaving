  <!-- INDUCTION -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">Begin by taking a slow breath in...<break time="3s"/> hold gently...<break time="3s"/> and exhale for six...<break time="4s"/> again... breathe in for four...<break time="3s"/> hold for four...<break time="3s"/> exhale for six...<break time="4s"/> And as you breathe...<break time="2s"/> let the crown of your head soften...<break time="2s"/> your forehead smooth...<break time="2s"/> your eyes resting...<break time="2s"/> jaw unhinging...<break time="2.5s"/> shoulders drifting down...<break time="2.5s"/> arms heavy and warm...<break time="2.5s"/> chest rising and falling...<break time="2.5s"/> belly releasing...<break time="2.5s"/> hips loosening...<break time="2.5s"/> thighs relaxing...<break time="2.5s"/> knees soft...<break time="2.5s"/> calves settling...<break time="2.5s"/> ankles and feet resting...<break time="2.5s"/> Each breath carries you deeper...<break time="2.5s"/> more relaxed...<break time="2.5s"/> more open...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">let go</emphasis> of anything that does not serve you now...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">drift</emphasis> at your own pace...<break time="2.5s"/> You decide...<break time="2s"/> in your own way...<break time="2s"/> how far and how deep...<break time="2.5s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/> a gentle countdown from ten to one...<break time="2s"/> Ten...<break time="1s"/> drifting...<break time="2s"/> Nine...<break time="1s"/> softer...<break time="2s"/> Eight...<break time="1s"/> deeper...<break time="2s"/> Seven...<break time="1s"/> calm...<break time="2s"/> Six...<break time="1s"/> still...<break time="2s"/> Five...<break time="1s"/> floating...<break time="2s"/> Four...<break time="1s"/> ease...<break time="2s"/> Three...<break time="1s"/> quiet...<break time="2s"/> Two...<break time="1s"/> open...<break time="2s"/> One...<break time="2s"/>

  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">And now you find yourself...<break time="2s"/> in a sacred temple...<break time="2.5s"/> vast, ancient, yours alone...<break time="3s"/> High columns rise around you...<break time="2s"/> supporting a ceiling of stars...<break time="2.5s"/> At the center...<break time="2s"/> an altar of white stone...<break time="2.5s"/> and doorways leading...<break time="2s"/> to realms you have yet to explore...<break time="3s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/> become aware of your body...<break time="2s"/> here, in this sacred space...<break time="2.5s"/> You have a body here too...<break time="2s"/> Feel your feet...<break time="2s"/> on this temple floor...<break time="2.5s"/> Feel your heart beating...<break time="2s"/> in this chest...<break time="2.5s"/> Your hands...<break time="2s"/> that can reach out and touch...<break time="2.5s"/> You are fully present...<break time="2s"/> in this realm...<break time="3s"/>

A doorway opens...<break time="2.5s"/> and cool mist flows in...<break time="2.5s"/> carrying the scent of rain and wild rose...<break time="2.5s"/> You step through...<break time="2.5s"/> into a vast sky...<break time="2.5s"/> where floating isles drift like gentle ships...<break time="2.5s"/> wrapped in arcane mists...<break time="2.5s"/> You see colors shifting...<break time="2.5s"/> indigo, silver, emerald...<break time="2.5s"/> You hear soft harmonic tones...<break time="2.5s"/> distant crystal chimes...<break time="2.5s"/> and the whisper of wind...<break time="2.5s"/> You feel cool air against your skin...<break time="2.5s"/> the light touch of mist...<break time="2.5s"/> You taste a clean, mineral sweetness...<break time="2.5s"/> like mountain water...<break time="2.5s"/>

You notice a bridge of light forming...<break time="2.5s"/> a path of luminous steps...<break time="2.5s"/> and you choose...<break time="2.5s"/> in your own time...<break time="2.5s"/> to walk toward the first isle...<break time="2.5s"/> As you step...<break time="2.5s"/> the mist parts...<break time="2.5s"/> revealing a garden suspended in the sky...<break time="2.5s"/> a garden of floating petals...<break time="2.5s"/> and a warm, golden light...<break time="2.5s"/>

There you meet The Rose Mother...<break time="2.5s"/> not as a literal being...<break time="2.5s"/> but as a psychological metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/> representing the nurturing, healing capacity within you...<break time="2.5s"/> She is a symbol...<break time="2.5s"/> of compassionate care...<break time="2.5s"/> and you are invited to notice...<break time="2.5s"/> how her presence feels...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> her kindness...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> it to soften old tightness...<break time="2.5s"/>

She offers a rose made of light...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can sense its warmth...<break time="2.5s"/> its soft petals against your palm...<break time="2.5s"/> its fragrance...<break time="2.5s"/> sweet and earthy...<break time="2.5s"/> As you hold it...<break time="2.5s"/> you feel a gentle glow in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> a warmth that spreads...<break time="2.5s"/> and begins to <emphasis level="moderate">heal</emphasis> what has been strained...<break time="2.5s"/> You notice how easily you <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis> into this care...<break time="2.5s"/>

And then...<break time="2.5s"/> a path of floating stones appears...<break time="2.5s"/> leading upward...<break time="2.5s"/> toward a higher isle...<break time="2.5s"/> You can move quickly or slowly...<break time="2.5s"/> whichever feels right...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you do...<break time="2.5s"/> the mist becomes a shimmering veil...<break time="2.5s"/> You notice spirals of light...<break time="2.5s"/> like sacred geometry...<break time="2.5s"/> a flower-of-life pattern...<break time="2.5s"/> opening and closing with your breath...<break time="2.5s"/>

Here stands the World Tree Guardian...<break time="2.5s"/> a symbol...<break time="2.5s"/> representing the part of you that stabilizes...<break time="2.5s"/> grounds...<break time="2.5s"/> and protects growth...<break time="2.5s"/> This archetype is a metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/> for your inner strength...<break time="2.5s"/> You see an immense tree...<break time="2.5s"/> roots flowing into the clouds...<break time="2.5s"/> branches holding constellations...<break time="2.5s"/> leaves shimmering like emerald glass...<break time="2.5s"/> You hear the tree hum softly...<break time="2.5s"/> a low, steady tone...<break time="2.5s"/> and you feel the cool bark beneath your fingertips...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Guardian invites you to place your hand upon the tree...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">sense</emphasis> how your own roots grow...<break time="2.5s"/> grounded in what is true...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what does not serve...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> a quiet steadiness...<break time="2.5s"/> This steadiness is yours...<break time="2.5s"/> in your own way...<break time="2.5s"/> as you decide...<break time="2.5s"/>

A misty staircase rises...<break time="2.5s"/> leading to a third isle...<break time="2.5s"/> and you step into a sanctuary of light...<break time="2.5s"/> Here the Inner Healer appears...<break time="2.5s"/> not as a separate spirit...<break time="2.5s"/> but as the wisdom within you...<break time="2.5s"/> your own capacity to mend, renew, and restore...<break time="2.5s"/> You sense a gentle presence...<break time="2.5s"/> a warmth in the air...<break time="2.5s"/> like sunlight through mist...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Inner Healer offers a crystal bowl...<break time="2.5s"/> filled with clear, luminous water...<break time="2.5s"/> You bring it to your lips...<break time="2.5s"/> and taste a cool sweetness...<break time="2.5s"/> You feel it flow through you...<break time="2.5s"/> and your neural pathways begin to rewire...<break time="2.5s"/> each breath reinforcing new, healthy patterns...<break time="2.5s"/> In that theta state of deep creativity...<break time="2.5s"/> your mind naturally begins to <emphasis level="moderate">reorganize</emphasis> around what serves you most...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">embrace</emphasis> this renewal...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> your inner guidance...<break time="2.5s"/>

You notice a glowing doorway...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can choose to go deeper now...<break time="2s"/> or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/> and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="1.5s"/> simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>

As you enter...<break time="2.5s"/> you find a sky-temple floating in the arcane mists...<break time="2.5s"/> wide terraces...<break time="2.5s"/> pools of light...<break time="2.5s"/> and a great mandala on the floor...<break time="2.5s"/> a spiral pattern that seems to breathe...<break time="2.5s"/> In the center...<break time="2.5s"/> a key of blue fire appears...<break time="2.5s"/> You reach out...<break time="2.5s"/> and feel its warmth...<break time="2.5s"/> It is a symbol of access...<break time="2.5s"/> to your own wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">open</emphasis> a new way of being...<break time="2.5s"/> and <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> what you carry forward...<break time="2.5s"/>

You walk to the edge of the isle...<break time="2.5s"/> and look out across the floating isles...<break time="2.5s"/> Each isle is a memory...<break time="2.5s"/> a lesson...<break time="2.5s"/> a possibility...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can sense infinite potential...<break time="2.5s"/> collapsing into what you choose now...<break time="2.5s"/> You are safe...<break time="2.5s"/> you are supported...<break time="2.5s"/> you are free...<break time="2.5s"/> to move forward in your own way...<break time="2.5s"/>

You notice the mists shifting...<break time="2.5s"/> revealing a gentle path back toward the temple...<break time="2.5s"/> and you know you can return at any time...<break time="2.5s"/> with the rose of light...<break time="2.5s"/> the rooted strength of the world tree...<break time="2.5s"/> and the inner healer’s clear water...<break time="2.5s"/> These are metaphors for what is already within you...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you breathe...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">integrate</emphasis> them...<break time="2.5s"/></prosody>

  <!-- INTEGRATION & RETURN -->
