Welcome.<break time="2s"/>

I am The Sacred Digital Dreamweaver...<break time="1.5s"/>
and in the next thirty minutes...<break time="1s"/>
you are invited on a sacred journey...<break time="2s"/>
into the heart of the Apache warrior tradition...<break time="2.5s"/>

This is the Apache Scout Vision Quest...<break time="2s"/>
a path-working that honors the ancient wisdom...<break time="1.5s"/>
of those who walked these lands...<break time="1.5s"/>
with eyes that saw everything...<break time="1.5s"/>
and hearts that feared nothing.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience...<break time="2s"/>
fully aware and in control...<break time="1.5s"/>
able to return to normal waking consciousness...<break time="1.5s"/>
at any moment you choose...<break time="2s"/>
simply by opening your eyes.<break time="3s"/>

This journey will awaken within you...<break time="1.5s"/>
the gifts of the scout...<break time="1.5s"/>
keen perception...<break time="1s"/>
unwavering focus...<break time="1s"/>
silent knowing...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the courage to trust what you see.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/>
or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/>

Allow your eyes to close when you feel ready...<break time="2s"/>
and take a deep...<break time="1s"/>
nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/>
breathing in clarity...<break time="2s"/>
and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="3.5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And as you settle here...<break time="2s"/>
begin to notice your breath...<break time="2s"/>
the gentle rise and fall...<break time="1.5s"/>
of your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>

Each breath carrying you deeper...<break time="2s"/>
into a state of peaceful awareness...<break time="3s"/>
like the scout who sits perfectly still...<break time="2s"/>
watching the canyon at dawn.<break time="3.5s"/>

Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold gently...<break time="4s"/>
and release for six...<break time="6s"/>

Again...<break time="1s"/>
drawing in clarity...<break time="4s"/>
holding that stillness...<break time="4s"/>
and releasing completely...<break time="6s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
beginning at the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/>
allow a wave of relaxation...<break time="1.5s"/>
to move gently downward...<break time="3s"/>

Your forehead softens...<break time="2s"/>
the space between your eyebrows releases...<break time="2s"/>
your jaw unclenches...<break time="2s"/>
and your throat becomes open and free.<break time="3s"/>

This wave of deep calm...<break time="1.5s"/>
continues down through your shoulders...<break time="2s"/>
which drop and release...<break time="2s"/>
down through your arms...<break time="1.5s"/>
all the way to your fingertips...<break time="2.5s"/>
which may begin to tingle...<break time="1.5s"/>
with gentle energy.<break time="3s"/>

Your chest expands and softens...<break time="2s"/>
your belly rises and falls...<break time="1.5s"/>
like breath itself is breathing you...<break time="3s"/>

Down through your hips...<break time="1.5s"/>
your thighs...<break time="1.5s"/>
your knees...<break time="1.5s"/>
your calves...<break time="1.5s"/>
all the way down to the soles of your feet...<break time="2s"/>
which rest heavy...<break time="1.5s"/>
warm...<break time="1.5s"/>
connected to the earth beneath you.<break time="3.5s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
I'm going to count down from ten to one...<break time="2s"/>
and with each number...<break time="1.5s"/>
you drift deeper...<break time="1.5s"/>
into the place where visions are born.<break time="3.5s"/>

Ten...<break time="1.5s"/>
letting go...<break time="2s"/>

Nine...<break time="1.5s"/>
sinking deeper...<break time="2s"/>

Eight...<break time="1.5s"/>
releasing everything...<break time="2s"/>

Seven...<break time="1.5s"/>
drifting down...<break time="2s"/>

Six...<break time="1.5s"/>
deeper still...<break time="2s"/>

Five...<break time="1.5s"/>
halfway there...<break time="2s"/>

Four...<break time="1.5s"/>
so peaceful now...<break time="2s"/>

Three...<break time="1.5s"/>
almost there...<break time="2s"/>

Two...<break time="1.5s"/>
nearly complete...<break time="2s"/>

One...<break time="3s"/>
you have arrived.<break time="4s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
You open your eyes...<break time="2s"/>
and you are standing...<break time="1.5s"/>
at the edge of a vast desert canyon...<break time="2.5s"/>
in the moments before dawn.<break time="3s"/>

The air is cool against your skin...<break time="2s"/>
carrying the scent of sage and juniper...<break time="2s"/>
and something ancient...<break time="1.5s"/>
something that has always been here.<break time="3s"/>

Above you...<break time="1.5s"/>
the sky is still dark...<break time="1.5s"/>
scattered with stars that seem close enough to touch...<break time="2.5s"/>
each one a point of pure light...<break time="2s"/>
witnessing your journey.<break time="3s"/>

You are dressed as a scout...<break time="2s"/>
simple clothing that moves with you...<break time="1.5s"/>
soft leather that makes no sound...<break time="2s"/>
and you carry nothing...<break time="1.5s"/>
except your awareness.<break time="3.5s"/>

And there...<break time="2s"/>
standing at the rim of the canyon...<break time="2s"/>
is a figure.<break time="2.5s"/>

This is your guide...<break time="2s"/>
an elder scout...<break time="1.5s"/>
whose eyes have seen a thousand dawns...<break time="2s"/>
whose feet know every stone...<break time="1.5s"/>
whose spirit moves like wind through the canyons.<break time="3s"/>

The guide does not speak...<break time="2s"/>
but gestures...<break time="1.5s"/>
and you understand completely.<break time="2.5s"/>

You are to follow.<break time="3s"/>

And so you begin...<break time="2s"/>
placing one foot...<break time="1s"/>
then another...<break time="1.5s"/>
descending into the canyon...<break time="2s"/>
on a path that seems to know you...<break time="2s"/>
as much as you know it.<break time="3s"/>

With each step...<break time="1.5s"/>
something within you awakens...<break time="2s"/>
your senses becoming sharper...<break time="1.5s"/>
more alive...<break time="1.5s"/>
more present.<break time="3s"/>

You notice the texture of the sand beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/>
how it shifts and gives...<break time="1.5s"/>
how it holds the memory of those who walked before.<break time="3s"/>

You notice the sound...<break time="1.5s"/>
or rather the silence...<break time="2s"/>
so deep it has its own quality...<break time="2s"/>
like the earth itself is listening.<break time="3s"/>

You notice the changing light...<break time="2s"/>
as the first hint of dawn...<break time="1.5s"/>
begins to touch the canyon walls...<break time="2s"/>
turning red rock to copper...<break time="1.5s"/>
then to gold.<break time="3s"/>

And you notice...<break time="2s"/>
that you are seeing...<break time="1.5s"/>
not just with your eyes...<break time="2s"/>
but with something deeper...<break time="2s"/>
a knowing that comes from within.<break time="3.5s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The guide stops...<break time="2s"/>
and points to the sky.<break time="2.5s"/>

There...<break time="2s"/>
circling high above...<break time="1.5s"/>
is an eagle.<break time="2.5s"/>

You watch as it soars...<break time="2s"/>
effortless...<break time="1.5s"/>
seeing everything...<break time="1.5s"/>
from impossible heights...<break time="2s"/>
and somehow...<break time="1.5s"/>
you begin to see through its eyes.<break time="3.5s"/>

The canyon spreads below...<break time="2s"/>
vast and intricate...<break time="1.5s"/>
every detail visible...<break time="2s"/>
every movement clear.<break time="2.5s"/>

You see the path ahead...<break time="2s"/>
you see the hidden water...<break time="2s"/>
you see where danger might lie...<break time="2s"/>
and where safety waits.<break time="3s"/>

This is the gift of the Oracle of Light...<break time="2s"/>
the ability to see truly...<break time="1.5s"/>
to perceive what others miss...<break time="2s"/>
to know without knowing how you know.<break time="3.5s"/>

And as you return to your own eyes...<break time="2s"/>
you carry this vision with you...<break time="2s"/>
this clarity...<break time="1.5s"/>
this sight.<break time="3s"/>

The guide leads you deeper...<break time="2s"/>
into a narrow passage between towering rocks...<break time="2.5s"/>
where the walls seem to close around you...<break time="2s"/>
and the light becomes dim.<break time="3s"/>

Here...<break time="1.5s"/>
you must trust your other senses.<break time="2.5s"/>

You feel the cool air currents...<break time="2s"/>
guiding you forward...<break time="1.5s"/>
you smell water somewhere ahead...<break time="2s"/>
you hear the subtle echo of your footsteps...<break time="2s"/>
telling you the shape of the space around you.<break time="3s"/>

And you realize...<break time="2s"/>
that sight is only one way of seeing...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the scout knows...<break time="1.5s"/>
how to read the world...<break time="1.5s"/>
with every sense available.<break time="3.5s"/>

The passage opens...<break time="2s"/>
and you emerge into a hidden canyon...<break time="2s"/>
where a spring flows from the rock face...<break time="2.5s"/>
creating a pool of crystal-clear water.<break time="3s"/>

The guide gestures...<break time="1.5s"/>
and you kneel...<break time="1.5s"/>
cupping your hands...<break time="1.5s"/>
and drinking deeply.<break time="3s"/>

The water is cold...<break time="1.5s"/>
pure...<break time="1.5s"/>
alive.<break time="2.5s"/>

And as it flows into you...<break time="2s"/>
you feel something shift...<break time="2s"/>
a healing...<break time="1.5s"/>
a restoration...<break time="2s"/>
as if every cell in your body...<break time="1.5s"/>
is being renewed.<break time="3.5s"/>

This is the blessing of the Great Physician...<break time="2.5s"/>
the waters that heal...<break time="1.5s"/>
the source that restores...<break time="2s"/>
the spring that never runs dry.<break time="3.5s"/>

You rest here for a moment...<break time="2s"/>
beside the sacred pool...<break time="2s"/>
and you understand...<break time="1.5s"/>
that this place exists within you...<break time="2s"/>
that you can return here...<break time="1.5s"/>
whenever you need.<break time="3.5s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The sun is fully risen now...<break time="2s"/>
and the guide leads you up...<break time="1.5s"/>
climbing higher...<break time="1.5s"/>
toward a mesa that rises above the canyon floor.<break time="3s"/>

Your legs are strong...<break time="1.5s"/>
your breath is steady...<break time="1.5s"/>
and you climb with the ease...<break time="1.5s"/>
of one who belongs here.<break time="3s"/>

At the top...<break time="2s"/>
the guide stops...<break time="1.5s"/>
and steps aside...<break time="2s"/>
revealing a flat expanse of red stone...<break time="2s"/>
and there...<break time="1.5s"/>
in the center...<break time="2s"/>
is a circle of white stones.<break time="3s"/>

You know this place.<break time="2.5s"/>

This is the vision circle...<break time="2s"/>
where the scouts come...<break time="1.5s"/>
to receive their knowing...<break time="2s"/>
to see what must be seen.<break time="3.5s"/>

You step into the circle...<break time="2s"/>
and sit facing the east...<break time="2s"/>
where the sun blazes golden.<break time="3s"/>

And you wait...<break time="3s"/>
in perfect stillness...<break time="2.5s"/>
patient as stone...<break time="2s"/>
open as sky.<break time="3.5s"/>

And she comes.<break time="3s"/>

Sophia...<break time="2s"/>
Divine Wisdom...<break time="2s"/>
appearing not as a person...<break time="1.5s"/>
but as pure light...<break time="2s"/>
a radiance that fills the circle...<break time="2s"/>
and fills you.<break time="3.5s"/>

And in this light...<break time="2s"/>
you see everything.<break time="3s"/>

You see your path clearly...<break time="2s"/>
the choices that await you...<break time="2s"/>
the gifts you carry...<break time="2s"/>
the purpose you serve.<break time="3s"/>

You see the obstacles that seemed so large...<break time="2s"/>
revealed as small...<break time="1.5s"/>
manageable...<break time="1.5s"/>
temporary.<break time="3s"/>

You see the fears that held you back...<break time="2s"/>
dissolving like morning mist...<break time="2s"/>
in the light of truth.<break time="3s"/>

And you see yourself...<break time="2s"/>
not as you thought you were...<break time="2s"/>
but as you truly are...<break time="2.5s"/>
strong...<break time="1.5s"/>
clear...<break time="1.5s"/>
capable...<break time="1.5s"/>
wise.<break time="3.5s"/>

The light speaks without words...<break time="2s"/>
and you understand completely...<break time="2.5s"/>
receiving wisdom...<break time="1.5s"/>
that you will carry with you...<break time="1.5s"/>
for all your days.<break time="4s"/>

And then...<break time="2s"/>
gently...<break time="1.5s"/>
the light begins to fade...<break time="2s"/>
not leaving you...<break time="1.5s"/>
but settling within you...<break time="2s"/>
becoming part of you...<break time="2s"/>
a flame that will never go out.<break time="4s"/>

The guide appears beside you once more...<break time="2s"/>
and together you descend from the mesa...<break time="2.5s"/>
carrying your vision...<break time="1.5s"/>

The journey back is swift...<break time="2s"/>
as if the canyon itself...<break time="1.5s"/>
is helping you return...<break time="2s"/>
the path rising to meet your feet.<break time="3s"/>

And as you walk...<break time="1.5s"/>
you understand that you are different now...<break time="2.5s"/>
changed by what you have seen...<break time="2s"/>

you will trust your inner knowing...<break time="2s"/>

and you feel it...<break time="1.5s"/>
a warmth...<break time="1.5s"/>
a recognition...<break time="1.5s"/>
a blessing.<break time="3s"/>

And then the guide steps back...<break time="2s"/>
