  <!-- INDUCTION -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">And now, begin to breathe...<break time="2.5s"/>
Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/> hold for four...<break time="4s"/> exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>
Again... in for four...<break time="4s"/> hold for four...<break time="4s"/> out for six...<break time="6s"/>
You may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how easily you <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
And as feels right to you, allow your forehead to soften...<break time="2.5s"/>
Let your eyes rest...<break time="2s"/> cheeks soften...<break time="2s"/> jaw unclench...<break time="2.5s"/>
Shoulders drop...<break time="2.5s"/> arms heavy...<break time="2.5s"/> hands warm...<break time="2.5s"/>
Chest loosens...<break time="2.5s"/> belly softens...<break time="2.5s"/>
Hips relax...<break time="2.5s"/> thighs release...<break time="2.5s"/> calves ease...<break time="2.5s"/>
And feet resting... fully supported...<break time="3s"/>
You choose to go deeper, in your own time...<break time="2.5s"/> and in your own way...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now a gentle countdown... ten...<break time="1s"/> nine...<break time="1s"/> eight...<break time="1s"/> seven...<break time="1s"/> six...<break time="1s"/> five...<break time="1s"/> four...<break time="1s"/> three...<break time="1s"/> two...<break time="1s"/> one...<break time="2s"/>
And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">And now you find yourself standing on a quiet lane...<break time="3s"/>
The air is cool and clean...<break time="2.5s"/> carrying the scent of earth and rain...<break time="3s"/>
Above you rises an infinite beanstalk... spiraling up into a sky lit with dawn...<break time="4s"/>
You see dew on the leaves... shimmering like tiny prisms...<break time="3s"/>
You hear a soft rustle... leaves breathing with your breath...<break time="3s"/>
You feel the bark beneath your fingertips... textured, living, steady...<break time="3s"/>
And you may taste the clean sweetness of the morning air...<break time="2.5s"/>
As you step closer, a golden gate appears at the base...<break time="3s"/>
Upon it stands The Portal Keeper... not as a literal being...<break time="2.5s"/> but as a psychological metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/> representing the part of you that knows when a new season is ready...<break time="3s"/>
The Portal Keeper is a symbol of wise thresholds...<break time="2.5s"/> and your discernment remains clear as you approach...<break time="3s"/>
You may <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a key in your hand... a key of intention...<break time="3s"/>
And when you choose, you turn it...<break time="2.5s"/> the gate opens...<break time="3s"/>
You choose to step through, in your own time...<break time="3s"/>

Up the beanstalk you climb... slowly... steadily...<break time="3s"/>
With every step, you <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> old scarcity...<break time="3s"/>
With every breath, you <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> new wisdom...<break time="3s"/>
You notice the color of the sky shift from pale gold to deep sapphire...<break time="3s"/>
A gentle hum surrounds you, like distant strings...<break time="3s"/>
You feel a warm breeze against your cheeks...<break time="3s"/>
And the leaves whisper, saying you are safe... you are supported... you are free...<break time="3.5s"/>

Soon you arrive at a cloud-garden...<break time="3s"/>
Soft moss under your feet...<break time="2.5s"/> luminous mist drifting like silk...<break time="3s"/>
There, a figure appears as a symbol... The Dream Architect...<break time="3s"/>
Not a spirit, not a power outside you...<break time="2.5s"/> but a metaphor for your God-given capacity to design a life of wise abundance...<break time="3s"/>
You notice the Architect holds a scroll...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you look, the scroll reveals the patterns of your wealth...<break time="3.5s"/>
Patterns of stewardship... of generosity... of creativity...<break time="3s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how these patterns feel in your body...<break time="3s"/>
Perhaps as warmth in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> or a steady strength in your spine...<break time="3s"/>
And as you breathe...<break time="2s"/> your neural pathways begin to <emphasis level="moderate">rewire</emphasis> toward ease with resources...<break time="3.5s"/>
You may choose to accept a symbol from the Architect...<break time="2.5s"/>
A compass of clarity...<break time="2.5s"/> a ledger of wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/> a seed of opportunity...<break time="3s"/>
Notice what appears...<break time="3s"/>
And as you hold it, you <emphasis level="moderate">recognize</emphasis> that wealth grows from faithful practice...<break time="3s"/>

And now a path opens across the garden...<break time="3s"/>
You walk toward a luminous fountain...<break time="3s"/>
Water flows with gentle light, the scent of jasmine rising...<break time="3s"/>
You touch the water... it is cool and alive...<break time="3s"/>
You taste a single drop... sweet and clear...<break time="3s"/>
And with that taste, you <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis> that abundance is also peace, and peace multiplies abundance...<break time="3.5s"/>

Now a staircase of clouds rises ahead...<break time="3s"/>
You can choose to go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2.5s"/>
or you can wait...<break time="2s"/>
and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="2s"/>
simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>
You climb the staircase, and with each step you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> new prosperity beliefs to settle...<break time="3s"/>
Your mind enters a theta state of deep creativity...<break time="3s"/>
You are fully aware, fully discerning, fully in control...<break time="3s"/>

At the top, a radiant archway opens...<break time="3s"/>
Here appears The Providence Angel... not as a literal being...<break time="2.5s"/> but as a symbol of God’s provision and faithful care...<break time="3s"/>
This is the part of you that trusts the timing of blessings...<break time="3s"/>
You may <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a gentle light resting over your shoulders...<break time="3s"/>
Christ walks with you here...<break time="2.5s"/> and you are rooted in Christ as you receive what serves your highest good...<break time="3s"/>
The Providence Angel offers a simple phrase...<break time="2.5s"/> “steward well, receive well”...<break time="3s"/>
And you allow those words to echo in your heart...<break time="3s"/>

A great table appears, crafted of living wood...<break time="3s"/>
Upon it rests a bowl of golden seeds...<break time="3s"/>
You are invited to take three...<break time="3s"/>
The first seed is wisdom... the second is courage... the third is generosity...<break time="4s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">plant</emphasis> them now...<break time="3s"/>
And as you do, you feel the soil of your life responding...<break time="3s"/>
Your choices align with clarity...<break time="3s"/>
Your habits align with value...<break time="3s"/>
Your relationships align with mutual blessing...<break time="3s"/>

Now you notice a stair of light descending into a grand vault...<break time="3s"/>
It is not a place of greed...<break time="2.5s"/> but of stewardship and purpose...<break time="3s"/>
Here you see shelves of time, attention, energy, and money...<break time="3s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">organize</emphasis> them with care...<break time="3s"/>
Every shelf is clear and orderly...<break time="3s"/>
You feel the smooth wood, smell cedar and citrus, hear the soft click of order settling in...<break time="4s"/>
And you realize wealth is a rhythm...<break time="3s"/>
A rhythm of giving and receiving...<break time="3s"/>
A rhythm of creating and resting...<break time="3s"/>
A rhythm of sowing and reaping...<break time="3s"/>

You notice a mirror of water in the center...<break time="3s"/>
As you look, you see a future self...<break time="3s"/>
A version of you who is calm, generous, and wisely prosperous...<break time="3s"/>
This is not a spirit...<break time="2.5s"/> it is a reflection of your own potential...<break time="3s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">learn</emphasis> from the reflection...<break time="3s"/>
Perhaps you notice posture... a steady gaze... a peaceful smile...<break time="3s"/>
Let that image settle into you...<break time="3s"/>

And now the vault opens into a sky terrace...<break time="3s"/>
You hear birds calling...<break time="2.5s"/> a soft wind across banners...<break time="3s"/>
You smell sun-warmed herbs...<break time="2.5s"/> you feel the warmth on your face...<break time="3s"/>
You taste a sip of honeyed water...<break time="3s"/>
And you understand, at depth, that prosperity is aligned with service...<break time="3.5s"/>
Your will remains engaged... your discernment clear... your heart steady...<break time="3s"/>
You can choose to go even deeper into trust...<break time="3s"/>
Or you can notice that trust is already growing...<break time="3s"/>
Either way, you are growing...<break time="4s"/>

A final gift appears... a small golden amulet shaped like a beanstalk spiral...<break time="3s"/>
This symbol reminds you of God’s provision and your wise action...<break time="3s"/>
You place it near your heart...<break time="2.5s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> steady courage...<break time="3s"/>
Your mind naturally begins to <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what no longer serves...<break time="3s"/>
And you <emphasis level="moderate">embrace</emphasis> a life of faithful abundance...<break time="3s"/>

  <!-- INTEGRATION & RETURN -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">And now, beginning to return...<break time="3s"/>
Bringing back with you this feeling of clarity and calm...<break time="3s"/>
And in the minutes...<break time="1.2s"/> hours...<break time="1.2s"/> even days ahead...<break time="1.5s"/> insights continue unfolding...<break time="3.5s"/>
as your mind gently reorganizes around what serves you most...<break time="4s"/>
You remember the garden, the vault, the mirror, the amulet...<break time="3s"/>

Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time="2.5s"/>
