jasmine perhaps...<break time=\"2s\"/> or ylang-ylang.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nYou can feel the ground beneath your feet...<break time=\"2s\"/> solid...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> ancient black

\"You seek the fire within...<break time=\"2s\"/> the transformation that burns away what no longer serves...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and leaves only truth...<break time=\"2s\"/> only essence...<break

to climb...<break time=\"2s\"/> higher now...<break time=\"2s\"/> the path becoming steeper...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> the air growing warmer...<break time=\"2s\"/> and you can hear it now...<break

time=\"4.5s\"/>\n\nAnd when you are ready...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> you extend your hands...<break time=\"2s\"/> and you release the rose...<break time=\"3s\"/> watching as it falls...<break

power...<break time=\"2s\"/> and an unshakeable knowing of your own sacred worth.<break time=\"5s\"/>\n\nThe Rose Mother places her hand over your heart...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and whispers...<break
