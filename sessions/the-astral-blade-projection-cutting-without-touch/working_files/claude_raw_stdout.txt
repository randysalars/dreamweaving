you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">feel</emphasis> the weight of your body here...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> your feet grounded...<break time=\"2s\"/> your hands at your sides.<break time=\"3s\"/> You have a body here...<break time=\"2s\"/> in this sacred space.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nThe air tastes clean...<break time=\"2s\"/> like mountain spring water.<break time=\"2.5s\"/> You can hear...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> a gentle humming...<break time=\"2s\"/> as if the chamber itself...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> is singing.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd now...<break time=\"2s\"/> three figures begin to appear.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nTo your right...<break time=\"2s\"/> a presence emerges...<break time=\"2s\"/> wrapped in robes the color of soft rose petals.<break time=\"3s\"/> You feel

time=\"3s\"/> This is the Guardian Father.<break time=\"3s\"/> His strength is not harsh...<break time=\"2s\"/> but gentle as a mountain.<break time=\"2.5s\"/> He nods to you...<break time=\"2s\"/> and you feel protected...<break time=\"2s\"/> held...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> championed.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd before you...<break time=\"2s\"/> directly ahead...<break time=\"2s\"/> a third figure appears...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> robed in luminous green and gold.<break time=\"3s\"/> This is your Inner Healer.<break time=\"3s\"/> The part of you that has always known...<break time=\"2s\"/> exactly what needs to be released.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nThe Inner Healer steps forward...<break time=\"2s\"/> and extends a hand toward you.<break time=\"3s\"/> And as you look...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> you see resting in that open palm...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> a blade of pure light.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nNot metal.<break time=\"2s\"/> Not sharp in a way that harms.<break time=\"2.5s\"/> But a blade of radiant...<break time=\"2s\"/> crystalline...<break time=\"2s\"/> astral energy.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nIt pulses softly...<break time=\"2s\"/> glowing with colors you have never seen before.<break time=\"3s\"/> Silver...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> gold...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> violet...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> all swirling together.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe Inner Healer speaks...<break time=\"2s\"/> and the voice is gentle...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> kind...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> but certain.<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\n\"This blade...<break time=\"2s\"/> is yours.<break time=\"2.5s\"/> It has always been yours.<break time=\"3s\"/> It cuts without violence.<break time=\"2.5s\"/> It severs without pain.<break time=\"3s\"/> It is the sacred tool...<break time=\"2s\"/> of your own liberation.\"<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd you reach out...<break time=\"2s\"/> and take the blade into your hand.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nIt is weightless...<break time=\"2s\"/> yet you can feel its presence.<break time=\"2.5s\"/> It hums...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> vibrating gently...<break time=\"2s\"/> tuning itself to your energy.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe Rose Mother steps closer now...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and She places Her hand over your heart.<break time=\"3s\"/> You feel warmth spreading through your chest.<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\n\"Before you cut...<break time=\"2s\"/> you must see with compassion...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> what binds you.\"<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nAnd as She speaks...<break time=\"2s\"/> you

golden...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> beautiful...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> connecting you to all you love.<break time=\"3s\"/> These you will not cut.<break time=\"3s\"/> But others...<break time=\"2s\"/> you see them now...<break time=\"2s\"/> are gray...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> heavy...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> draining.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nOne thread leads back...<break time=\"2s\"/> to an old belief...<break time=\"2s\"/> that you are not enough.<break time=\"3.5s\"/> Another...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> to a pattern of people-pleasing...<break time=\"2s\"/> at the cost of your own truth.<break time=\"3.5s\"/> Another...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> to shame...<break time=\"2s\"/> that was never yours to carry.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe Rose Mother whispers...<break time=\"2s\"/> \"Cut with love...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> not with anger.<break time=\"3s\"/> Release...<break time=\"2s\"/> not reject.\"<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd the Guardian Father...<break time=\"2s\"/> steps forward on your other side.<break time=\"3s\"/> His voice is steady...<break time=\"2s\"/> grounding.<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\n\"I am here...<break time=\"2s\"/> to ensure that what you release...<break time=\"2s\"/> cannot return.<break time=\"3s\"/> Cut...<break time=\"2s\"/> and I will stand guard.<break time=\"3s\"/> You are safe...<break time=\"2s\"/> to let go.\"<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd now...<break time=\"2s\"/> the Inner Healer guides your hand.<break time=\"3s\"/> You lift the astral blade...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and bring it gently...<break time=\"2s\"/> to the first gray thread.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nThe moment the blade touches...<break time=\"2s\"/> the thread glows bright...<break time=\"2s\"/> and dissolves.<break time=\"3s\"/> No pain.<break time=\"2s\"/> Only release.<break time=\"3s\"/> A lightness...<break time=\"2s\"/> spreading through your body.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\n[SFX: Crystalline chime with shimmer, high and pure, 3 seconds]\n\nYou move to the next thread.<break time=\"2.5s\"/> The blade cuts...<break time=\"2s\"/> and again...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> that old pattern...<break time=\"2s\"/> simply...<break time=\"1s\"/> evaporates.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nOne by one...<break time=\"2s\"/> you cut away...<break time=\"2s\"/> what does not serve.<break time=\"3s\"/> Shame.<break time=\"2s\"/> Fear.<break time=\"2s\"/> Doubt.<break time=\"2s\"/> The voices of others...<break time=\"2s\"/> still echoing in your mind.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nEach cut...<break time=\"2s\"/> is an act of self-love.<break time=\"3s\"/> Each severance...<break time=\"2s\"/> a reclaiming of your power.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd the Rose Mother holds you in Her compassion.<break time=\"3s\"/> The Guardian Father stands strong at your back.<break time=\"3s\"/> The Inner Healer guides your hand with precision.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nYou are not alone...<break time=\"2s\"/> in this sacred work.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nAnd when the last thread is cut...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> you stand...<break time=\"2s\"/> free.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nThe chamber fills with golden light.<break time=\"3s\"/> You feel lighter...<break time=\"2s\"/> clearer...<break time=\"2s\"/> more yourself...<break time=\"2s\"/> than you have in years.<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe Inner Healer takes the blade from your hand...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and places it over your heart.<break time=\"3s\"/> And as the blade touches your chest...<break time=\"2s\"/> it dissolves...<break time=\"2s\"/> merging with your being.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\n\"The blade is always with you now...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> whenever you need it.<break time=\"3s\"/> Just place your hand over your heart...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and call it forth.\"<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe three guides...<break time=\"2s\"/> the Rose Mother...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> the Guardian Father...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> the Inner Healer...<break time=\"2s\"/> all place their hands over yours...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> over your heart.<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nAnd you feel a transmission...<break time=\"2s\"/> a blessing...<break time=\"2s\"/> a permanent
