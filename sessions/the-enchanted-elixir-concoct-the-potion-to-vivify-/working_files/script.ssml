    you find yourself standing at the threshold of a luminous workshop...<break time="3s"/>
    a place that feels both ancient and familiar...<break time="3s"/>
    a sanctified space of creativity...<break time="3s"/>
    where imagination aligns with God-given purpose...<break time="3s"/>
    The air is cool and clear...<break time="2.5s"/>
    scented with rosemary and frankincense...<break time="3s"/>
    and a hint of warm honey...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the soft glow of lanterns...<break time="2.5s"/>
    their light reflecting in copper and glass...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> the gentle texture of a wooden table under your hands...<break time="2.5s"/>
    The floor beneath you is stone...<break time="2.5s"/>
    cool, steady, grounding...<break time="2.5s"/>
    like the foundation of truth...<break time="2.5s"/>
    In your own way, you decide to step forward...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and a quiet hum surrounds you...<break time="2.5s"/>
    like a distant choir of wind and water...<break time="3s"/>
    [SFX: Gentle wind chimes and distant stream, 8s bed]
    You notice sacred geometry etched into the table...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a spiral, a flower of life, an interlocking lattice...<break time="3s"/>
    shimmering with light...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a reminder that your mind can be renewed...<break time="2.5s"/>

    And Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time="2.5s"/>

    [SFX: Soft bubbling cauldron, warm and soothing, 6s]
    On the table, you see an empty crystal vial...<break time="2.5s"/>

    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> the intention you wish to place within it...<break time="3s"/>
    Name it quietly in your heart...<break time="3s"/>
    a goal aligned with God’s goodness...<break time="2.5s"/>
    something that blesses you and those around you...<break time="3s"/>
    You might notice a golden glow in the air...<break time="2.5s"/>

    reminding you of steady support...<break time="3s"/>
    and a blueprint of light...<break time="2.5s"/>
    the Dream Architect symbol...<break time="2.5s"/>
    reflecting your creativity...<break time="3s"/>
    and a luminous gate...<break time="2.5s"/>
    the Portal Keeper symbol...<break time="2.5s"/>
    reminding you to move with discernment...<break time="3s"/>
    As you breathe...<break time="2s"/>
    you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the colors of your intention...<break time="2.5s"/>
    perhaps a deep emerald...<break time="2.5s"/>
    or a radiant sapphire...<break time="2.5s"/>
    or a warm sunrise gold...<break time="2.5s"/>
    Let that color stream into the vial...<break time="2.5s"/>
    filling it with light...<break time="3s"/>
    And then...<break time="2s"/>
    you reach for the first ingredient...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a vial of clear water...<break time="2.5s"/>
    drawn from a spring of renewal...<break time="2.5s"/>
    It tastes like crystalline purity...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> it to symbolize clarity of mind...<break time="3s"/>
    As you pour it...<break time="2s"/>
    hear the sound...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a gentle trickle...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a reminder that truth flows quietly yet powerfully...<break time="3s"/>
    [SFX: Clear water pour, delicate, 3s]
    Next...<break time="2s"/>
    you add a pinch of sea salt...<break time="2.5s"/>
    symbolizing grounded action...<break time="2.5s"/>
    the tangible steps you will take...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to take those steps in your own time...<break time="3s"/>
    Then...<break time="2s"/>
    a drop of honey...<break time="2.5s"/>
    sweet and golden...<break time="2.5s"/>
    reminding you that joy is part of the journey...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> joy to accompany your progress...<break time="3s"/>
    The aroma rises...<break time="2s"/>
    warm, floral, soothing...<break time="2.5s"/>
    engaging your sense of smell...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and the taste of sweetness lingers in the air...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You add a sprig of rosemary...<break time="2.5s"/>
    for memory and focus...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and a ribbon of cinnamon...<break time="2.5s"/>
    for warmth and courage...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the colors deepening...<break time="2.5s"/>
    the liquid shimmering with subtle light...<break time="3s"/>
    [SFX: Low shimmer and subtle sparkle, 5s]
    Now you sense a gentle presence...<break time="2.5s"/>
    the Providence Angel symbol...<break time="2.5s"/>
    as a reminder of God’s provision...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> a feeling of safety...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You may hear a soft tone...<break time="2.5s"/>
    like a single note in the distance...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis> even more...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You are safe...<break time="2s"/>
    you are supported...<break time="2s"/>
    you are free...<break time="2.5s"/>
    The Dream Architect symbol now comes forward...<break time="2.5s"/>
    as a metaphor for your inner creativity...<break time="2.5s"/>
    It presents a scroll of light...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a blueprint of your desired reality...<break time="3s"/>
    You can <emphasis level="moderate">imagine</emphasis> a scene...<break time="2.5s"/>
    in which your goal is already alive...<break time="3s"/>
    See it...<break time="2s"/>
    hear it...<break time="2s"/>
    feel it...<break time="2s"/>
    smell it...<break time="2s"/>
    and taste the fulfillment...<break time="3s"/>
    Allow those sensations to flow into the vial...<break time="3s"/>
    coloring the elixir with vivid life...<break time="3s"/>
    Now the Portal Keeper symbol appears...<break time="2.5s"/>
    as a metaphor for discernment...<break time="2.5s"/>
    reminding you to act with wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/>
    to wait when needed...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and to move when the door opens...<break time="3s"/>
    You can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to go deeper now...<break time="2.5s"/>
    or you can wait...<break time="2s"/>
    and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="2.5s"/>
    simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>
    The elixir begins to glow...<break time="2.5s"/>
    pulsing with light...<break time="2.5s"/>
    breathing with your breath...<break time="3s"/>
    Colors brighten on each inhale...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and soften on each exhale...<break time="3s"/>
    You can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> this rhythm to entrain your mind...<break time="3s"/>
    guiding your brain toward a gentle theta state...<break time="3s"/>

    holding it in your palm...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">anchor</emphasis> your intention within it...<break time="3s"/>
    a symbol of focus...<break time="2.5s"/>
    steady and clear...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You place it beside the vial...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and notice a quiet sense of resolve...<break time="3s"/>
    The elixir is nearly complete...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you are aware of the warmth in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>

    Now...<break time="2s"/>
    lift the vial...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and hold it close...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You may even imagine tasting a single drop...<break time="2.5s"/>
    sweet and clear...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a taste of fulfillment...<break time="2.5s"/>
