Welcome.<break time="2s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="1.5s"/> you are invited on a sacred journey...<break time="2s"/> into the realm of the Second Horizon...<break time="2.5s"/> where an ancient angel waits...<break time="2s"/> to guide you into deeper healing...<break time="2s"/> deeper knowing...<break time="2.5s"/> and a remembrance of the wholeness that has always lived within you.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience...<break time="2s"/> fully in control...<break time="1.5s"/> able to return to normal waking awareness at any moment you choose...<break time="2s"/> simply by opening your eyes.<break time="3s"/>

Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time="2.5s"/> held in unwavering love...<break time="2s"/> guided by wisdom that serves your highest good.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/> perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/> or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/> Ensure you will not be disturbed for the next half hour.<break time="2s"/> If you are able...<break time="1s"/> wear headphones to receive the full depth of this journey.<break time="3s"/>

Allow your eyes to close when you feel ready...<break time="2.5s"/> and take a deep...<break time="1s"/> nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/> breathing in peace...<break time="2s"/> and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

And as you settle into this space...<break time="2.5s"/> notice the natural rhythm of your breathing...<break time="2s"/> the gentle rise and fall of your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> each breath carrying you deeper...<break time="2s"/> into stillness...<break time="2.5s"/> into peace.<break time="3.5s"/>

Breathe in deeply for four...<break time="4s"/> hold gently for four...<break time="4s"/> and exhale slowly for six...<break time="6s"/>

Again...<break time="1s"/> breathing in...<break time="4s"/> holding...<break time="4s"/> and releasing...<break time="6s"/>

This wave of relaxation continues...<break time="2s"/> drifting down over your cheeks...<break time="2s"/> your jaw releasing...<break time="2s"/> your tongue resting gently in your mouth...<break time="2.5s"/> all the tiny muscles of your face...<break time="2s"/> simply <emphasis level="moderate">letting go</emphasis>.<break time="4s"/>

[SFX: Deep harmonic hum, resonant and enveloping, low frequency warmth, continuous 8 seconds]

The relaxation flows down into your neck...<break time="2s"/> your shoulders dropping...<break time="2.5s"/> heavy and at ease...<break time="2s"/> melting down through your arms...<break time="2s"/> your elbows...<break time="1.5s"/> your wrists...<break time="1.5s"/> all the way to your fingertips...<break time="3s"/> which may begin to tingle...<break time="2s"/> with gentle warmth.<break time="3.5s"/>

And this wave moves deeper still...<break time="2s"/> washing through your chest...<break time="2s"/> your heart space opening...<break time="2.5s"/> your lungs expanding easily...<break time="2s"/> your belly softening...<break time="2.5s"/> releasing any holding...<break time="2s"/> any protection you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

Down through your hips...<break time="2s"/> your thighs...<break time="2s"/> your knees...<break time="2s"/> your calves and shins...<break time="2.5s"/> all the way down to your ankles...<break time="2s"/> your feet...<break time="2s"/> and the tips of your toes...<break time="3s"/> your entire body now resting...<break time="2s"/> fully supported...<break time="2.5s"/> completely <emphasis level="moderate">at peace</emphasis>.<break time="4.5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
You find yourself standing...<break time="2s"/> in a vast meadow...<break time="2.5s"/> at the edge of twilight.<break time="3s"/>

The sky above you is neither day nor night...<break time="2.5s"/> but something in between...<break time="2s"/> a luminous threshold...<break time="2s"/> painted in shades of deep violet...<break time="2s"/> rose gold...<break time="2s"/> and silver blue.<break time="3.5s"/>

The air is soft against your skin...<break time="2s"/> cool and welcoming...<break time="2.5s"/> carrying the scent of wild roses...<break time="2s"/> and distant rain.<break time="3s"/>

Beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/> the earth is warm...<break time="2s"/> alive...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can feel a gentle pulse...<break time="2s"/> a heartbeat...<break time="2s"/> rising up through the soles of your feet...<break time="2.5s"/> connecting you to something ancient...<break time="2s"/> something vast.<break time="4s"/>

And as you stand here...<break time="2s"/> you notice...<break time="2s"/> at the far edge of the meadow...<break time="2.5s"/> a great tree rising.<break time="3s"/>

It is unlike any tree you have ever seen...<break time="2.5s"/> its trunk wide as a cathedral...<break time="2s"/> its branches reaching upward...<break time="2s"/> and outward...<break time="2s"/> and inward...<break time="2.5s"/> as if holding all directions at once.<break time="3.5s"/>

Its leaves shimmer with a light of their own...<break time="2s"/> emerald and gold...<break time="2.5s"/> whispering secrets to the wind.<break time="3.5s"/>

You feel drawn to this tree...<break time="2.5s"/> and you begin to walk toward it...<break time="2s"/> each step easy...<break time="2s"/> natural...<break time="2s"/> as if your soul has walked this path before.<break time="4s"/>

[SFX: Soft footsteps on grass, gentle rustling leaves, pastoral warmth, 6 seconds]

As you approach...<break time="2s"/> you see a figure standing at the base of the tree.<break time="3s"/>

Tall...<break time="2s"/> radiant...<break time="2s"/> draped in robes of light...<break time="2.5s"/> woven from threads of dawn and dusk.<break time="3s"/>

This is the Angel of the Second Horizon...<break time="2.5s"/> guardian of the space between waking and dreaming...<break time="2s"/> keeper of the threshold where healing begins.<break time="4s"/>

The angel's face is kind...<break time="2s"/> ancient...<break time="2s"/> and filled with a knowing compassion...<break time="2.5s"/> eyes like deep pools of starlight...<break time="2s"/> seeing all of you...<break time="2s"/> and loving all of you.<break time="4s"/>

The angel speaks...<break time="2s"/> and the voice is like music...<break time="2s"/> like wind through silver bells...<break time="2.5s"/> resonating in your chest...<break time="2s"/> in your bones.<break time="3.5s"/>

"Welcome...<break time="2s"/> beloved one...<break time="2.5s"/> you who have journeyed far to arrive here.<break time="3s"/> I have been waiting for you.<break time="3.5s"/> Come...<break time="2s"/> rest beneath the World Tree...<break time="2.5s"/> and receive what you have always needed."<break time="5s"/>

And you do.<break time="2.5s"/>

You move closer...<break time="2s"/> and sit at the base of the great tree...<break time="2.5s"/> your back resting against its warm...<break time="2s"/> sturdy trunk.<break time="3s"/>

The bark is smooth and alive beneath you...<break time="2.5s"/> pulsing gently...<break time="2s"/> cradling you like a mother's arms.<break time="3.5s"/>

The angel kneels beside you...<break time="2.5s"/> and places a hand upon your heart.<break time="3s"/>

You feel warmth there...<break time="2s"/> a golden light beginning to glow...<break time="2.5s"/> spreading outward from your center...<break time="2s"/> filling your chest...<break time="2s"/> your belly...<break time="2s"/> your limbs.<break time="4s"/>

[SFX: Warm tonal drone, healing frequency, golden shimmer, continuous 10 seconds]

"Within you lives the Inner Healer...<break time="2.5s"/> the one who has always known how to mend what is broken...<break time="2.5s"/> how to <emphasis level="moderate">restore</emphasis> what has been lost...<break time="2.5s"/> how to call you back to wholeness."<break time="4s"/>

And as the angel speaks...<break time="2s"/> you feel it...<break time="2.5s"/> a presence rising within you...<break time="2s"/> gentle and strong...<break time="2.5s"/> your own deepest self...<break time="2s"/> your own sacred physician.<break time="4s"/>

Images begin to arise...<break time="2.5s"/> scenes from your life...<break time="2s"/> moments where you were wounded...<break time="2s"/> where you felt alone...<break time="2.5s"/> where you lost your way.<break time="3.5s"/>

But now...<break time="2s"/> the Inner Healer moves through these memories...<break time="2.5s"/> not to erase them...<break time="2s"/> but to <emphasis level="moderate">transform</emphasis> them...<break time="2.5s"/> to touch each one with compassion...<break time="2s"/> with forgiveness...<break time="2s"/> with love.<break time="4.5s"/>

You watch as old pain softens...<break time="2.5s"/> as old stories loosen their grip...<break time="2.5s"/> as wounds you thought would never close...<break time="2s"/> begin to knit together...<break time="2s"/> gently...<break time="2s"/> naturally...<break time="2.5s"/> in their own perfect time.<break time="5s"/>

The angel rises...<break time="2s"/> and gestures upward...<break time="2.5s"/> to the branches of the World Tree.<break time="3s"/>

"Look...<break time="2s"/> and see what grows here."<break time="3.5s"/>

You lift your gaze...<break time="2s"/> and there...<break time="2s"/> among the leaves...<break time="2.5s"/> you see roses blooming.<break time="3s"/>

White roses...<break time="2s"/> pink roses...<break time="2s"/> deep crimson roses...<break time="2.5s"/> each one luminous...<break time="2s"/> each one exquisite...<break time="2.5s"/> filling the air with a fragrance so sweet...<break time="2s"/> it brings tears to your eyes.<break time="4s"/>

And standing among the roses...<break time="2.5s"/> you see her...<break time="2s"/> the Rose Mother.<break time="3s"/>

A figure of infinite tenderness...<break time="2.5s"/> draped in petals...<break time="2s"/> her hands open...<break time="2s"/> her smile soft as dawn.<break time="3.5s"/>

She reaches down...<break time="2s"/> and plucks a single white rose...<break time="2.5s"/> and offers it to you.<break time="3.5s"/>

"This is yours...<break time="2.5s"/> a gift of purity...<break time="2s"/> of new beginnings...<break time="2.5s"/> of the part of you that has never been touched by darkness."<break time="5s"/>

You receive the rose...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you hold it...<break time="2s"/> you feel something shift within you...<break time="2.5s"/> a remembering...<break time="2s"/> a return to innocence...<break time="2.5s"/> not the innocence of ignorance...<break time="2s"/> but the innocence of one who has walked through fire...<break time="2.5s"/> and emerged <emphasis level="moderate">whole</emphasis>.<break time="5s"/>

[SFX: Gentle harp glissando, ascending light, celestial beauty, 4 seconds]

The Rose Mother speaks...<break time="2.5s"/> her voice like petals falling on water.<break time="3s"/>

"You are held...<break time="2s"/> beloved...<break time="2.5s"/> held by the roots of this tree...<break time="2s"/> held by the earth beneath you...<break time="2.5s"/> held by the love that has always surrounded you...<break time="2s"/> even when you could not feel it."<break time="5s"/>

And it is true...<break time="2.5s"/> you can feel it now...<break time="2s"/> the immense support beneath you...<break time="2.5s"/> the way the World Tree connects you...<break time="2s"/> to every living thing...<break time="2.5s"/> to the vast web of existence...<break time="2s"/> to the heart of God.<break time="4.5s"/>

You rest here...<break time="2.5s"/> held between earth and sky...<break time="2s"/> between the angel and the tree...<break time="2.5s"/> between who you were...<break time="2s"/> and who you are becoming.<break time="4s"/>

And in this sacred pause...<break time="2.5s"/> you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to simply be.<break time="4s"/>

No striving...<break time="2s"/> no fixing...<break time="2s"/> no searching.<break time="3s"/>

Just this.<break time="3s"/>

Just you.<break time="3s"/>

Just now.<break time="5s"/>
