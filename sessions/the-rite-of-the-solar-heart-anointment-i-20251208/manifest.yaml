  title: 'The Rite of the Solar Heart Anointment'
  topic: 'The Rite of the Solar Heart Anointment is a sacred ritual that aligns your
    heart with the ancient Solar Intelligence of Joy. In the first step, the Summoning
    of the Radiant Sun, you stand beneath a vast golden sun hovering inches above
    you, its surface rippling with laughter-light. Then comes the Oil of Aeternal
    Joy, as a beam of sunlight liquefies into golden oil that pours gently into your
    heart center, filling you with euphoria, warm innocence, cosmic safety, divine
    affirmation, and heart-opening bliss. Finally, during the Coronation of the Joyful
    Sovereign, a crown of solar petals forms above your head, and as it settles, a
    voice speaks: You are now a Keeper of the Solar Joy Flame. This act completes
    the anointment, permanently igniting the Solar Heart-Flame within you.'
