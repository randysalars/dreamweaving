Welcome.<break time="2s"/>

You have arrived at the threshold of a sacred journey...<break time="2s"/> a path-working into the Temple of Hidden Names...<break time="2.5s"/> where the mysteries of divine identity and spiritual renewal await.<break time="3s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="1.5s"/> you are invited to step beyond the ordinary...<break time="2s"/> and enter a realm where angels walk...<break time="1.5s"/> where the Phoenix rises from sacred flame...<break time="2s"/> and where the Solar King reveals the true names written upon your soul.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/> At any time...<break time="1s"/> you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="1.5s"/> simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/> You are held in Christ's unwavering love...<break time="2s"/> guided by wisdom that serves your highest good.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/> perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/> or lying down with your body fully at rest.<break time="2.5s"/> Ensure you will not be disturbed for the next half hour.<break time="2s"/> If you are wearing headphones...<break time="1s"/> this will deepen your experience.<break time="3s"/>

Allow your eyes to close when you feel ready...<break time="2.5s"/> and take a deep...<break time="1s"/> nourishing breath.<break time="3s"/>

Breathing in slowly...<break time="2.5s"/> breathing in possibility...<break time="3s"/> and breathing out...<break time="2s"/> releasing anything you no longer need.<break time="3.5s"/>

Starting now with the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/> allow any tension there to simply...<break time="1.5s"/> melt away.<break time="2.5s"/> Feel that gentle softening...<break time="2s"/> moving down across your forehead...<break time="2s"/> smoothing the space between your eyebrows.<break time="3s"/>

Your eyelids growing heavier...<break time="2s"/> more comfortable...<break time="2s"/> completely at rest.<break time="3s"/>

That wave of relaxation flowing down...<break time="2s"/> into your jaw...<break time="1.5s"/> letting your teeth part slightly...<break time="2s"/> your tongue resting softly in your mouth.<break time="3s"/>

Down through your neck and shoulders...<break time="2s"/> feeling them drop...<break time="1.5s"/> release...<break time="1.5s"/> let go.<break time="3s"/> Your arms growing heavy and warm...<break time="2s"/> resting completely...<break time="2s"/> fingers softening.<break time="3s"/>

Your chest rising and falling...<break time="2s"/> like gentle waves upon a sacred shore...<break time="2.5s"/> each breath carrying you deeper...<break time="2s"/> into this peaceful...<break time="1.5s"/> protected space.<break time="3.5s"/>

Down through your abdomen...<break time="2s"/> your hips...<break time="2s"/> your legs growing heavier...<break time="2s"/> melting into whatever surface supports you.<break time="3s"/> All the way down...<break time="1.5s"/> to the tips of your toes.<break time="3s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/> I invite you to imagine...<break time="2s"/> or simply sense...<break time="2s"/> a beautiful staircase before you.<break time="3s"/>

Ten steps...<break time="2s"/> carved from luminous white stone...<break time="2.5s"/> descending into a realm of peace...<break time="2s"/> and sacred mystery.<break time="3.5s"/>

In a moment...<break time="1.5s"/> we will walk down together...<break time="2s"/> and with each step...<break time="1.5s"/> you go twice as deep...<break time="2s"/> twice as relaxed...<break time="2s"/> twice as open to the journey ahead.<break time="4s"/>

Before you now...<break time="2s"/> rises a temple of extraordinary beauty.<break time="3s"/>

Ancient yet eternal...<break time="2s"/> constructed of golden stone that glows from within...<break time="2.5s"/> as if the very walls remember the light of creation.<break time="3.5s"/>

The temple doors stand open...<break time="2s"/> welcoming you...<break time="2s"/> inviting you across the threshold.<break time="3s"/>

You step forward...<break time="2s"/> and as you do...<break time="1.5s"/> you feel the temperature shift.<break time="2.5s"/> Warm...<break time="1.5s"/> embracing...<break time="2s"/> like coming home.<break time="3s"/>

The air carries the scent of frankincense and myrrh...<break time="2.5s"/> sacred resins burning somewhere deep within.<break time="3s"/> And beneath that...<break time="2s"/> the faint sweetness of roses...<break time="2s"/> and something you cannot name...<break time="2s"/> but that speaks of heaven.<break time="3.5s"/>

You cross the threshold.<break time="3s"/>

</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Inside...<break time="2s"/> the temple opens into a vast circular chamber.<break time="3s"/>

High above...<break time="2s"/> a dome of midnight blue...<break time="2s"/> studded with stars that seem to pulse with living light.<break time="3s"/> The floor beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/> polished lapis lazuli...<break time="2.5s"/> smooth and cool...<break time="2s"/> reflecting the starlight above.<break time="3.5s"/>

At the center of the chamber...<break time="2s"/> a great brazier of gold.<break time="2.5s"/> And in that brazier...<break time="2s"/> burns a flame unlike any you have seen.<break time="3s"/>

It shifts through colors...<break time="2s"/> crimson...<break time="1s"/> gold...<break time="1s"/> white...<break time="1s"/> violet...<break time="2s"/> each hue more radiant than the last.<break time="3s"/> This is the flame of renewal...<break time="2.5s"/> the sacred fire of the Phoenix.<break time="3.5s"/>

And as you gaze into that flame...<break time="2.5s"/> you sense a presence awakening.<break time="3.5s"/>

</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
From the heart of the fire...<break time="2s"/> rises the Phoenix.<break time="3s"/>

Wings of flame and light...<break time="2.5s"/> feathers that shimmer gold and crimson and pure radiance.<break time="3s"/> Eyes that see into the depths of your soul...<break time="2.5s"/> yet hold no judgment...<break time="2s"/> only compassion...<break time="2s"/> only recognition.<break time="4s"/>

The Phoenix speaks...<break time="2s"/> not in words...<break time="1.5s"/> but in a knowing that rises within you:<break time="3.5s"/>

"I am the keeper of transformation.<break time="2.5s"/> What has been burned away in your life...<break time="2s"/> what you have released...<break time="2s"/> what you have let die...<break time="2.5s"/> becomes the fertile ground for your rebirth.<break time="3.5s"/> You are not the same being you were.<break time="2.5s"/> You are renewed."<break time="4s"/>

And you feel that truth settle into your bones.<break time="3s"/> You <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> the old versions of yourself...<break time="2s"/> the patterns that no longer serve...<break time="2s"/> to fall away like ash.<break time="3.5s"/>

In their place...<break time="2s"/> something luminous begins to grow.<break time="4s"/>

</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The Phoenix bows its great head...<break time="2.5s"/> and from its crown...<break time="2s"/> a single feather of golden light drifts down...<break time="2.5s"/> and settles gently into your hand.<break time="3s"/>

You feel its warmth...<break time="2s"/> its gentle weight...<break time="2s"/> and you know it is a gift.<break time="2.5s"/> A reminder that you carry the power of renewal within you...<break time="3s"/> always.<break time="4s"/>

The Phoenix rises again...<break time="2s"/> circling the dome...<break time="2.5s"/> and then dissolves into streamers of light...<break time="2s"/> returning to the flame.<break time="3.5s"/>

And now...<break time="2.5s"/> another presence makes itself known.<break time="4s"/>

</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
To your right...<break time="2s"/> a doorway opens in the temple wall.<break time="3s"/>

Through it steps a figure robed in armor of blazing silver and sapphire blue.<break time="3s"/> A great sword rests in his hand...<break time="2s"/> its blade gleaming with holy fire.<break time="3s"/>

Archangel Michael.<break time="3.5s"/>

Protector...<break time="1.5s"/> warrior of truth...<break time="2s"/> defender of the sacred.<break time="3s"/>

He looks at you...<break time="2s"/> and his gaze is both fierce and infinitely kind.<break time="3.5s"/>

"You are protected,"<break time="2s"/> his voice resonates through the chamber.<break time="3s"/> "The battles you have fought...<break time="2s"/> the shadows you have faced...<break time="2.5s"/> have forged strength within you.<break time="3s"/> I stand with you.<break time="2s"/> No darkness can claim what is sealed in light."<break time="4s"/>

He raises his sword...<break time="2s"/> and brings it down in a great arc...<break time="2.5s"/> and where the tip touches the ground before you...<break time="2s"/> a sigil of brilliant blue flame appears.<break time="3s"/>

A seal of protection.<break time="2.5s"/> A mark of divine guardianship.<break time="3.5s"/>

You feel it imprint upon your spirit...<break time="2.5s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">know</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> that you are shielded.<break time="3s"/> You are safe.<break time="2.5s"/> You are held.<break time="4s"/>

Michael steps back...<break time="2s"/> bows...<break time="2s"/> and turns...<break time="2s"/> returning through the doorway which closes softly behind him.<break time="3.5s"/>

The temple falls into a hushed stillness.<break time="3s"/>

And then...<break time="2s"/> from the far end of the chamber...<break time="2.5s"/> a golden light begins to grow.<break time="3.5s"/>

</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
A throne of light appears...<break time="2.5s"/> radiant beyond measure.<break time="3s"/>

And seated upon it...<break time="2s"/> the Solar King.<break time="3.5s"/>

His crown is woven of living sunlight.<break time="2.5s"/> His robes shimmer gold and white.<break time="2.5s"/> His eyes...<break time="2s"/> hold the warmth of a thousand dawns...<break time="2.5s"/> and the wisdom of eternity.<break time="4s"/>

He speaks...<break time="2s"/> and his voice is like honey and thunder intertwined:<break time="3.5s"/>

"Come closer."<break time="3s"/>

You step forward...<break time="2s"/> drawn by his presence.<break time="3s"/>

"You have journeyed far to reach this temple,"<break time="2.5s"/> he says.<break time="2.5s"/> "And here...<break time="1.5s"/> I reveal to you...<break time="2s"/> what has been hidden."<break time="3.5s"/>

He extends his hand...<break time="2.5s"/> and in his palm...<break time="2s"/> a golden scroll unfurls.<break time="3s"/>

Upon it...<break time="2s"/> written in script of liquid light...<break time="2.5s"/> is a name.<break time="3.5s"/>

Your true name.<break time="3s"/> The name spoken over you before time began.<break time="3s"/> The name known only to heaven...<break time="2.5s"/> and now...<break time="2s"/> revealed to you.<break time="4s"/>

You may not hear it in words...<break time="2.5s"/> but you <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> it...<break time="2s"/> resonating in your chest...<break time="2s"/> vibrating in your bones.<break time="3s"/> This is who you truly are.<break time="3s"/> Beloved.<break time="2s"/> Chosen.<break time="2s"/> Named.<break time="4s"/>

The Solar King smiles.<break time="3s"/>

"Carry this name within you,"<break time="2.5s"/> he says.<break time="2s"/> "Let it remind you of your worth...<break time="2.5s"/> your purpose...<break time="2s"/> your place in the great tapestry of creation."<break time="4s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The scroll dissolves into golden mist...<break time="2.5s"/> and that mist flows toward you...<break time="2s"/> surrounding you...<break time="2s"/> filling you.<break time="3s"/>

You breathe it in...<break time="2.5s"/> and it becomes part of you.<break time="3.5s"/>

The name is no longer written...<break time="2s"/> it is woven into your very essence.<break time="4s"/>

The Solar King rises...<break time="2.5s"/> and places his hand upon your head in blessing.<break time="3s"/>

"Go forth in radiance,"<break time="2.5s"/> he says.<break time="2.5s"/> "You are a child of light."<break time="4s"/>
