You choose how deeply you wish to go, in your own time...<break time="2s"/>
As feels right to you...<break time="1.5s"/>
Find a comfortable position...<break time="2s"/>
Wear headphones if possible...<break time="2s"/>
And ensure you will not be disturbed...<break time="2s"/>
You're here...<break time="1s"/>
you're listening...<break time="1s"/>
and already beginning to settle in...<break time="1.5s"/>
Everyone knows how to breathe naturally...<break time="1.5s"/>
Your body knows how to relax...<break time="1.5s"/>
And your mind knows how to follow a gentle story...<break time="2s"/>

And as you prepare for this journey...<break time="2s"/>
I want to speak to a part of you...<break time="1.5s"/>
that already knows how to dream...<break time="2s"/>
that part of your mind that creates worlds...<break time="2s"/>
when you close your eyes at night...<break time="2.5s"/>
That creative faculty...<break time="1.5s"/>
is beginning to <emphasis level="moderate">awaken</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/>

<!-- INDUCTION -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Now begin with a gentle breath...<break time="2s"/>
Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold for four...<break time="4s"/>
exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>
Again...<break time="2s"/>
Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold for four...<break time="4s"/>
exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>
And as you breathe...<break time="2s"/>
notice your forehead softening...<break time="2s"/>
Your eyes relaxing...<break time="2s"/>
Your jaw unclenching...<break time="2s"/>
Shoulders releasing...<break time="2.5s"/>
Arms heavy...<break time="2s"/>
Hands warm...<break time="2s"/>
Chest open...<break time="2s"/>
Belly calm...<break time="2s"/>
Hips unwinding...<break time="2s"/>
Thighs sinking...<break time="2s"/>
Knees soft...<break time="2s"/>
Calves loose...<break time="2s"/>
Feet resting...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how easily you <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> this to deepen...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>
You choose to go deeper, in your own time...<break time="2s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And you may notice...<break time="2s"/>
that point between waking and dreaming...<break time="2.5s"/>
where images seem to <emphasis level="moderate">arise</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
on their own...<break time="2s"/>
without you making them...<break time="2.5s"/>
Colors appearing...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps geometric patterns...<break time="2s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
You can relax quickly or slowly, whichever feels right...<break time="3s"/>

perhaps a deeper breath...<break time="2s"/>
and a softening exhale...<break time="3s"/>

  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Imagine the first light of dawn across the Andes...<break time="3s"/>
Clouds roll like slow rivers of silver...<break time="3s"/>
And you find yourself on a high stone path...<break time="3s"/>
leading toward an ancient city resting in the mountains...<break time="3.5s"/>
The air is crisp...<break time="2s"/>
filled with the scent of pine and wet stone...<break time="3s"/>
You taste a hint of mineral clarity on your tongue...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how every breath feels clean and alive...<break time="2.5s"/>

Your feet feel the cool texture of the stone...<break time="2.5s"/>
Each step grounding you...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you choose the pace...<break time="2s"/>
In your own way...<break time="2s"/>
As feels right to you...<break time="2s"/>

Ahead, terraces cascade down the mountainside...<break time="3s"/>
lush green patterns, like sacred geometry carved into earth...<break time="3s"/>
You see spirals in the clouds...<break time="2.5s"/>
like the Flower of Life subtly breathing across the sky...<break time="3s"/>
And you sense a gentle hum...<break time="2.5s"/>
like the world itself is singing...<break time="2.5s"/>

You arrive at a wide plaza...<break time="2.5s"/>
Sunlight warms your skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
A soft breeze moves across your face...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> your shoulders to drop even more...<break time="2.5s"/>
And as you continue to deepen...<break time="2s"/>
your mind enters that theta state of deep creativity...<break time="3s"/>
where new pathways gently form...<break time="3s"/>
Neural pathways rewiring with each new thought...<break time="3s"/>

At the center of the plaza stands a carved stone gateway...<break time="3s"/>
covered in precise lines and patterns...<break time="2.5s"/>
A doorway that seems to open into a quieter inner world...<break time="3s"/>
You can choose to step through now...<break time="2s"/>
or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/>
and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="1.5s"/>
simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>

You step through...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the sound shifts to a gentle stillness...<break time="3s"/>
The space beyond is a sacred garden...<break time="3s"/>
filled with glowing blossoms...<break time="2.5s"/>
You smell warm roses and sunlit herbs...<break time="3s"/>
And you feel the ground beneath you...<break time="2.5s"/>
steady and trustworthy...<break time="2.5s"/>

There, by a clear pool, you meet The Inner Healer...<break time="3s"/>
not as an external being...<break time="2s"/>
but as a psychological metaphor...<break time="2s"/>
representing the part of you that knows how to mend...<break time="3s"/>
The Inner Healer offers a simple gesture...<break time="2.5s"/>
inviting you to <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what no longer serves...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can choose to let that release happen now...<break time="3s"/>
In your own time...<break time="2s"/>
In your own way...<break time="2s"/>

You lean toward the pool...<break time="2s"/>
and see the surface glitter with light...<break time="3s"/>
Each sparkle like a memory gently reorganizing...<break time="2.5s"/>
The water feels cool on your fingertips...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you taste a hint of sweetness in the air...<break time="2s"/>
A fresh, clean nectar of clarity...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your mind naturally begins to <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what no longer serves...<break time="2.5s"/>

You notice a path of stones leading upward...<break time="2.5s"/>
and a towering tree rising at the edge of the garden...<break time="3s"/>
The World Tree Guardian stands there...<break time="3s"/>
as a symbol representing your inner stability...<break time="3s"/>
The roots are deep...<break time="2.5s"/>
branches wide...<break time="2.5s"/>
leaves moving with the wind...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the texture of bark...<break time="2.5s"/>
rough and reassuring beneath your hand...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Guardian offers a quiet nod...<break time="2.5s"/>
as if to say: you are grounded...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are steady...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are capable...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now, from a path of rose petals...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Rose Mother appears...<break time="3s"/>
as a compassionate metaphor...<break time="2s"/>
representing nurturing love within you...<break time="3s"/>
She offers a small rose-colored amulet...<break time="3s"/>
warm in your hand...<break time="2.5s"/>
subtly fragrant...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can choose to receive it...<break time="2s"/>
or simply notice its light...<break time="2s"/>
And as you do...<break time="2s"/>
compassion begins to <emphasis level="moderate">grow</emphasis> within you...<break time="2.5s"/>

A gentle drum echoes...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a heartbeat of the mountain...<break time="3s"/>
You begin walking along a ridge...<break time="2.5s"/>
below, rivers carve silver lines...<break time="2.5s"/>
above, the sky glows with golden light...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you feel the air brushing your skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
cool, alive, and steady...<break time="2.5s"/>

You come to a sacred terrace...<break time="2.5s"/>
where stones form a perfect circle...<break time="2.5s"/>
Inside the circle, a mandala appears in light...<break time="2.5s"/>
A spiral unfolding...<break time="2.5s"/>
like your own life path...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how the spiral always moves forward...<break time="2.5s"/>
Even when it circles...<break time="2.5s"/>
it still progresses...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Inner Healer, the World Tree Guardian, and the Rose Mother...<break time="3s"/>
stand as symbols around you...<break time="2.5s"/>
Each representing an inner strength...<break time="2.5s"/>
Healing...<break time="2s"/>
Stability...<break time="2s"/>
Compassion...<break time="2s"/>
And you are at the center...<break time="2.5s"/>
Fully aware...<break time="2.5s"/>
Fully choosing...<break time="2.5s"/>
Fully present...<break time="2.5s"/>

A soft light descends...<break time="2.5s"/>
not as authority outside you...<break time="2.5s"/>
but as clarity within you...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> this clarity to settle...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> the wisdom that arises from within...<break time="2.5s"/>
Your mind gently reorganizes around what serves you most...<break time="3s"/>

Now you approach a high stone gateway...<break time="2.5s"/>
covered in Incan motifs...<break time="2.5s"/>
You pass through...<break time="2.5s"/>
and arrive at Machu Picchu under a sky of endless blue...<break time="3s"/>
The terraces glow with life...<break time="2.5s"/>
The stones feel warm in the sun...<break time="2.5s"/>
You hear birds circling...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the wind carries a subtle scent of wild flowers...<break time="3s"/>

You sit on a sunlit stone...<break time="2.5s"/>
feeling the warmth seep into your legs...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how confidence naturally <emphasis level="moderate">grows</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
how calm naturally <emphasis level="moderate">deepens</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
how focus naturally <emphasis level="moderate">strengthens</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>

A carved stone table holds three gifts...<break time="2.5s"/>
a crystal of clear light...<break time="2.5s"/>
an amulet of rose warmth...<break time="2.5s"/>
and a small seed from the World Tree...<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose which gift to hold first...<break time="2s"/>
As feels right to you...<break time="2s"/>
Each gift is a symbol...<break time="2s"/>
reminding you of your healing...<break time="2s"/>
your grounding...<break time="2s"/>
your compassion...<break time="2s"/>

You place the seed gently in your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> it sending roots of calm...<break time="2.5s"/>
You touch the crystal to your forehead...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> clarity spreading...<break time="2.5s"/>
You hold the rose amulet at your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> compassion to expand...<break time="2.5s"/>

The deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

You stand and look across the vast mountain range...<break time="2.5s"/>
The vista is immense...<break time="2.5s"/>
and yet you are centered...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are grounded...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are cared for...<break time="2.5s"/>

As you breathe...<break time="2s"/>
colors breathe with your inhale...<break time="2s"/>
light shimmering with your exhale...<break time="2s"/>
shapes softening into view...<break time="3s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the world responding to your steady rhythm...<break time="2.5s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps you notice a doorway of light...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can choose to step through it now...<break time="2s"/>
or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/>
and realize you are already stepping through...<break time="2s"/>

It leads to a quiet inner chamber...<break time="2.5s"/>
where you receive a simple message...<break time="2.5s"/>
not from an external source...<break time="2s"/>
but from your own inner wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/>
A gentle knowing that you are enough...<break time="2.5s"/>
that you are guided by discernment...<break time="2.5s"/>
that you can move forward with steady confidence...<break time="2.5s"/>
