Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
In the next thirty minutes, you are invited on a sacred journey...<break time="2s"/>
a pathworking to the Mount of Calvary...<break time="2.5s"/>
where suffering becomes transformation...<break time="2s"/>
and the cross becomes the doorway to resurrection.<break time="3s"/>

You remain in complete control throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/>
At any time, you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="2s"/>
simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/>
Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time="2s"/>
and the Holy Spirit illuminates this path.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/>
or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/>
Allow your eyes to close when you feel ready...<break time="2s"/>
and take a deep, nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/>
breathing in the presence of Christ...<break time="2s"/>
and breathing out anything you no longer need to carry.<break time="3.5s"/>

This journey invites you to walk the ancient path...<break time="2s"/>
the Via Dolorosa...<break time="2s"/>
not as spectator, but as participant.<break time="2.5s"/>
You will encounter three guides along the way...<break time="2s"/>
The Inner Healer, who transforms suffering into wholeness...<break time="2s"/>
The World Tree Guardian, who roots you in the vertical axis of heaven and earth...<break time="2.5s"/>
and The Rose Mother, who holds you in compassion through every threshold.<break time="3.5s"/>

Allow yourself to receive...<break time="2s"/>
whatever insights come naturally.<break time="2.5s"/>
You choose to go deeper, in your own time...<break time="2s"/>
as feels right to you.<break time="3s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And now...<break time="2s"/>
bringing your awareness to the very top of your head...<break time="2.5s"/>
notice any tension there...<break time="2s"/>
and as you breathe in...<break time="2s"/>
imagine a golden light touching your crown...<break time="2.5s"/>
warm...<break time="1.5s"/>
gentle...<break time="1.5s"/>
dissolving any tightness.<break time="3s"/>

And as you exhale...<break time="2s"/>
that light flows down...<break time="2s"/>
through your forehead...<break time="1.5s"/>
softening your brow...<break time="2s"/>
relaxing the small muscles around your eyes...<break time="2.5s"/>
releasing your jaw.<break time="3s"/>

Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/>
hold gently...<break time="4s"/>
exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>
And again...<break time="2s"/>
breathe in, drawing peace...<break time="4s"/>
hold, letting it settle...<break time="4s"/>
exhale, releasing all that no longer serves.<break time="6s"/>

That golden light continues its journey...<break time="2s"/>
down through your neck and shoulders...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you may <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
how easily your shoulders <emphasis level="moderate">drop</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
letting go of burdens you've been carrying.<break time="3.5s"/>

Down through your chest...<break time="2s"/>
your heart space softening...<break time="2.5s"/>
your breath deepening naturally...<break time="2s"/>
as the light flows into your arms...<break time="2s"/>
your hands...<break time="2s"/>
your fingertips tingling with warmth.<break time="3s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="2s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go.<break time="4s"/>

The light continues down...<break time="2s"/>
through your belly...<break time="1.5s"/>
your lower back releasing...<break time="2s"/>
your hips softening...<break time="2s"/>
down through your legs...<break time="2s"/>
your knees...<break time="1.5s"/>
your ankles...<break time="1.5s"/>
all the way to the soles of your feet.<break time="3.5s"/>

You are held.<break time="2s"/>
You are safe.<break time="2s"/>
You are free to go deeper still.<break time="4s"/>

You have arrived.<break time="3s"/>

And here, in this sacred stillness...<break time="2.5s"/>
you find yourself standing on an ancient stone path...<break time="2.5s"/>
worn smooth by countless feet over countless centuries.<break time="3s"/>
The air is warm...<break time="2s"/>
carrying the scent of dust and olive trees...<break time="2.5s"/>
and something else...<break time="2s"/>
the faint trace of myrrh and frankincense.<break time="3.5s"/>

Above you, the sky is heavy...<break time="2s"/>
clouds gathering...<break time="2s"/>
the light dim and golden at the edges.<break time="3s"/>
You hear distant sounds...<break time="2s"/>
voices...<break time="1.5s"/>
footsteps...<break time="1.5s"/>
the world moving around you.<break time="3s"/>

And you know where this path leads.<break time="3s"/>

You can choose to go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/>
or you can wait...<break time="2s"/>
and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="2s"/>
simply by listening.<break time="4s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And as you stand on this path...<break time="2s"/>
you become aware of a presence beside you.<break time="3s"/>

To your left...<break time="2s"/>
The Inner Healer appears...<break time="2.5s"/>
robed in soft white linen...<break time="2s"/>
eyes filled with infinite compassion.<break time="3s"/>
This guide does not speak...<break time="2s"/>
but you feel a warmth radiating from them...<break time="2.5s"/>
a knowing that every wound you carry...<break time="2s"/>
is seen...<break time="1.5s"/>
is held...<break time="1.5s"/>
is being gently transformed.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer gestures forward...<break time="2s"/>
inviting you to walk.<break time="3s"/>

And so you begin.<break time="3s"/>

The path slopes upward...<break time="2s"/>
each step deliberate...<break time="2s"/>
each step a choice.<break time="3s"/>
You notice the texture beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/>
rough stone...<break time="1.5s"/>
small pebbles shifting...<break time="2s"/>
the solidity of the earth supporting you.<break time="3.5s"/>

As you walk, you pass through the narrow streets of Jerusalem...<break time="2.5s"/>
stone walls rising on either side...<break time="2s"/>
archways casting shadows...<break time="2s"/>
the scent of baking bread mingling with dust.<break time="3s"/>
You hear the echo of your own footsteps...<break time="2s"/>
and those of others who walked this way before you.<break time="3.5s"/>

And now, to your right...<break time="2s"/>
another presence joins.<break time="3s"/>

The World Tree Guardian.<break time="3s"/>

Tall...<break time="1.5s"/>
rooted...<break time="1.5s"/>
ancient beyond measure...<break time="2.5s"/>
this guide appears as a figure wrapped in bark and green vines...<break time="2.5s"/>
crowned with leaves that shimmer gold and crimson.<break time="3s"/>
You feel the axis of the world within them...<break time="2.5s"/>
the vertical thread connecting heaven and earth...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you understand that this journey is not horizontal alone...<break time="2.5s"/>
but vertical...<break time="2s"/>
a descent into depth...<break time="2s"/>
and an ascent into light.<break time="4s"/>

The path steepens.<break time="3s"/>

You begin to feel the weight of the climb...<break time="2s"/>
your breath coming a little heavier...<break time="2s"/>
your legs working...<break time="2s"/>
and with each step, you notice...<break time="2.5s"/>
you are carrying something.<break time="3s"/>

A burden.<break time="2.5s"/>

It may be grief...<break time="2s"/>
or shame...<break time="2s"/>
or a pattern you've held for years...<break time="2.5s"/>
or a wound inflicted by another...<break time="2.5s"/>
or by yourself.<break time="3s"/>

The Inner Healer walks beside you...<break time="2s"/>
and though the burden is heavy...<break time="2s"/>
you do not walk alone.<break time="4s"/>

Ahead, the path opens to a wider space...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you see it...<break time="2s"/>
the hill rising before you...<break time="2.5s"/>
Golgotha.<break time="3s"/>

The place of the skull.<break time="3s"/>

And here...<break time="2s"/>
a third guide steps forward to meet you.<break time="3.5s"/>

The Rose Mother.<break time="3s"/>

She is radiant...<break time="2s"/>
clothed in deep blue and crimson...<break time="2s"/>
her hands open...<break time="2s"/>
her face serene yet sorrowful...<break time="2.5s"/>
and in her presence, you feel permission...<break time="2s"/>
to feel everything...<break time="2s"/>
to grieve...<break time="2s"/>
to weep...<break time="2s"/>
to lay down what you have carried.<break time="4s"/>

She does not speak...<break time="2s"/>
but she extends her hand...<break time="2s"/>
and you understand.<break time="3s"/>

This is the threshold.<break time="3s"/>

You can choose to ascend the hill...<break time="2s"/>
in your own way...<break time="2s"/>
in your own time...<break time="2s"/>
carrying your burden to the cross...<break time="2.5s"/>
and releasing it there.<break time="4s"/>

And so you begin the final ascent.<break time="3.5s"/>

The wind rises as you climb...<break time="2s"/>
cool against your face...<break time="2s"/>
carrying the scent of rain.<break time="3s"/>
The sky darkens...<break time="2s"/>
clouds swirling...<break time="2s"/>
and you feel the weight of all that is being held in this moment.<break time="4s"/>

Step by step...<break time="2s"/>
breath by breath...<break time="2s"/>
The Inner Healer to your left...<break time="2s"/>
The World Tree Guardian to your right...<break time="2s"/>
The Rose Mother walking just ahead, her cloak billowing...<break time="2.5s"/>
you reach the summit.<break time="4s"/>

And there it stands.<break time="3s"/>

The cross.<break time="3s"/>

Rough-hewn wood...<break time="2s"/>
dark with age...<break time="2s"/>
planted deep in the rocky ground.<break time="3s"/>
You feel the tremor of the earth beneath you...<break time="2.5s"/>
the weight of history...<break time="2s"/>
the convergence of suffering and love.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother turns to you...<break time="2s"/>
and gently...<break time="2s"/>
she invites you to approach.<break time="3.5s"/>

You step forward...<break time="2s"/>
and as you do...<break time="2s"/>
you feel the burden you've been carrying...<break time="2s"/>
rising to the surface.<break time="3s"/>

Name it now, silently, in your heart.<break time="5s"/>

And with your next breath...<break time="2s"/>
imagine placing it at the foot of the cross.<break time="3s"/>

Watch as The Inner Healer kneels beside it...<break time="2.5s"/>
hands hovering over what you've released...<break time="2s"/>
light streaming from their palms...<break time="2.5s"/>
transforming suffering into something new.<break time="4s"/>

The World Tree Guardian extends roots from their feet...<break time="2.5s"/>
wrapping around the base of the cross...<break time="2s"/>
anchoring it...<break time="2s"/>
connecting this place to the axis of all creation...<break time="2.5s"/>
heaven touching earth...<break time="2s"/>
death touching life.<break time="4s"/>

And The Rose Mother stands behind you...<break time="2s"/>
her hands resting gently on your shoulders...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you feel her whisper without words...<break time="3s"/>

"You are held.<break time="2s"/>
You are loved.<break time="2s"/>
This is not the end.<break time="2s"/>
This is the passage."<break time="5s"/>

And as you stand there...<break time="2s"/>
the sky splits open.<break time="3s"/>

Light pours down...<break time="2s"/>
golden and blinding...<break time="2s"/>
washing over the cross...<break time="2s"/>
over you...<break time="2s"/>
over everything.<break time="3.5s"/>

You feel warmth flooding your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
a radiance that dissolves the edges of your pain...<break time="2.5s"/>
and in this moment...<break time="2s"/>
you understand.<break time="4s"/>

The cross is not where the story ends.<break time="3s"/>

It is the doorway.<break time="3s"/>

Through suffering...<break time="2s"/>
through surrender...<break time="2s"/>
through release...<break time="2s"/>
you are being made new.<break time="5s"/>

allowing you space to integrate what has occurred.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer touches your heart...<break time="2s"/>
and you feel a warmth settle there...<break time="2.5s"/>
a reminder that healing is not a single moment...<break time="2s"/>
but a continual unfolding.<break time="4s"/>

The World Tree Guardian places one hand on your crown...<break time="2s"/>
grounding you...<break time="2s"/>
rooting you in the axis of heaven and earth...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Rose Mother wraps you in her cloak...<break time="2.5s"/>

with a smile...<break time="2s"/>
and a blessing.<break time="3.5s"/>

days...<break time="1.5s"/>
even weeks ahead...<break time="2s"/>
insights continue unfolding...<break time="2s"/>
as your mind gently reorganizes around what serves you most.<break time="5s"/>

You walk back through the narrow streets...<break time="2s"/>
the stone walls now glowing soft gold in the returning light...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you feel the presence of Christ walking with you...<break time="2.5s"/>
not behind...<break time="1.5s"/>
but beside.<break time="3s"/>
