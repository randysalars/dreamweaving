Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
In the next thirty minutes, you are invited on a profound inner journey...<break time="2s"/>
a sacred exploration into the <emphasis level="moderate">Clockwork of the Unconscious</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
where the hidden mechanisms of your psyche reveal themselves...<break time="2s"/>
and healing wisdom flows from the deepest chambers of your being.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience...<break time="2s"/>
fully in control...<break time="1.5s"/>
able to return to normal waking awareness at any moment simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/>
or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="2.5s"/>

Allow your eyes to close when you are ready...<break time="2s"/>
and take a deep, nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/>
breathing in clarity...<break time="2s"/>
and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="3.5s"/>

This journey will guide you through the intricate workings of your inner world...<break time="2s"/>
the gears and wheels...<break time="1.5s"/>
the rhythms and patterns...<break time="1.5s"/>
that shape your thoughts, feelings, and dreams.<break time="3s"/>

You will meet three sacred presences...<break time="2s"/>
The Inner Healer, who knows the path to wholeness...<break time="2s"/>
The Heart Flame Tender, who guards the fire of your deepest truth...<break time="2s"/>
and The Rose Mother, who nurtures beauty from the soil of your soul.<break time="3.5s"/>

Trust that whatever you experience will be exactly what you need...<break time="2s"/>
in your own time...<break time="1.5s"/>
in your own way.<break time="3s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And now...<break time="2s"/>
beginning to settle...<break time="2s"/>
into this sacred space of inner exploration.<break time="3s"/>

Notice your breath...<break time="2s"/>
the gentle rise and fall...<break time="2s"/>
natural and easy...<break time="2.5s"/>
breathing in for a count of four...<break time="4s"/>
holding gently...<break time="4s"/>
and exhaling slowly for six...<break time="6s"/>

Each breath carrying you deeper...<break time="2.5s"/>
more relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
more open.<break time="3s"/>

Let your awareness travel now to the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/>
and simply <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
any tension there to soften...<break time="2s"/>
to release...<break time="2.5s"/>
like ice melting into warm water.<break time="3s"/>

This softening flows down into your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
smoothing away the lines of thought...<break time="2s"/>
relaxing the space between your brows...<break time="2.5s"/>
your eyelids growing heavy...<break time="2s"/>
so pleasantly heavy...<break time="2.5s"/>
resting closed.<break time="3s"/>

Your jaw releases...<break time="2s"/>
teeth slightly parted...<break time="2s"/>
tongue resting softly in your mouth...<break time="2.5s"/>
your throat open and free.<break time="3s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="2s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go.<break time="4s"/>

This wave of relaxation flows down your neck...<break time="2s"/>
into your shoulders...<break time="2s"/>
releasing burdens you didn't know you carried...<break time="2.5s"/>
down your arms...<break time="2s"/>
through your elbows...<break time="2s"/>
into your hands...<break time="2.5s"/>
all the way to your fingertips...<break time="2s"/>
which may begin to tingle...<break time="2s"/>
with this beautiful releasing.<break time="3.5s"/>

Your chest expands with each breath...<break time="2s"/>
your heart beating steady and strong...<break time="2s"/>
your ribs softening...<break time="2.5s"/>
your belly rising and falling...<break time="2s"/>
like gentle waves upon a shore.<break time="3s"/>

And I'm going to count down now from ten to one...<break time="2s"/>
and with each number...<break time="1.5s"/>
you drift twice as deep...<break time="2s"/>
twice as relaxed...<break time="2.5s"/>
twice as open to the wisdom within.<break time="3s"/>

Ten...<break time="1s"/>
sinking deeper...<break time="2s"/>
Nine...<break time="1s"/>
letting go...<break time="2s"/>
Eight...<break time="1s"/>
peaceful and safe...<break time="2s"/>
Seven...<break time="1s"/>
releasing...<break time="2s"/>
Six...<break time="1s"/>
deeper still...<break time="2s"/>
Five...<break time="1s"/>
halfway there...<break time="2s"/>
Four...<break time="1s"/>
so relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
Three...<break time="1s"/>
almost there...<break time="2s"/>
Two...<break time="1s"/>
deeper...<break time="2s"/>
and One...<break time="3s"/>
fully relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
fully present...<break time="2s"/>
ready to journey within.<break time="4s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now...<break time="2.5s"/>
you find yourself standing at the threshold of an extraordinary place...<break time="3s"/>
a vast chamber that exists within your own depths...<break time="2.5s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">The Workshop of the Unconscious</emphasis>.<break time="4s"/>

As your inner vision clears...<break time="2s"/>
you begin to see...<break time="2s"/>
the magnificent clockwork machinery that fills this space...<break time="3s"/>
gears of gold and silver...<break time="2s"/>
wheels within wheels...<break time="2s"/>
turning with ancient precision...<break time="2.5s"/>
each movement creating ripples of meaning...<break time="2s"/>
each rotation shaping the fabric of your dreams.<break time="3.5s"/>

The air here tastes of copper and honey...<break time="2s"/>
sweet metallic...<break time="2s"/>
alive.<break time="2.5s"/>
You can hear the soft ticking...<break time="2s"/>
the gentle whirring...<break time="2s"/>
the rhythmic pulse of countless mechanisms...<break time="2.5s"/>
working in harmony beneath your awareness.<break time="3s"/>

Warm amber light filters down from somewhere above...<break time="2s"/>
casting long shadows...<break time="2s"/>
making the gears glow...<break time="2s"/>
like embers in a sacred forge.<break time="3s"/>

You take a step forward...<break time="2s"/>
and feel the stone floor beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/>
solid and real...<break time="2s"/>
warmed by the energy of this place...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you notice that you are not alone.<break time="4s"/>

Standing beside a great wheel of polished brass...<break time="2.5s"/>
is a figure of gentle presence...<break time="2s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">The Inner Healer</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
robed in soft green and silver...<break time="2s"/>
eyes filled with compassion and knowing.<break time="3s"/>

The Healer turns to you and speaks...<break time="2.5s"/>
not with words but with feeling...<break time="2s"/>
and you understand completely...<break time="3s"/>
"This clockwork is the machinery of your becoming...<break time="2.5s"/>
Every gear represents a pattern...<break time="2s"/>
a belief...<break time="2s"/>
a memory...<break time="2s"/>
a habit of thought.<break time="3s"/>
Some serve you well...<break time="2s"/>
and some...<break time="2s"/>
are ready to be <emphasis level="moderate">transformed</emphasis>."<break time="4s"/>

The Healer gestures to a particular mechanism nearby...<break time="2.5s"/>
and as you look...<break time="2s"/>
you recognize it...<break time="3s"/>
This gear represents something old within you...<break time="2.5s"/>
a pattern that once protected you...<break time="2s"/>
but now only limits your expansion.<break time="3.5s"/>

You can see it clearly now...<break time="2s"/>
notice its shape...<break time="2s"/>
its color...<break time="2s"/>
the way it moves...<break time="2.5s"/>
or perhaps struggles to move.<break time="3s"/>

The Healer places a hand upon this gear...<break time="2s"/>
and it begins to glow with soft green light...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you feel a warmth spreading through your chest...<break time="2s"/>
as this old pattern is gently...<break time="2s"/>
lovingly...<break time="2s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">released</emphasis>.<break time="4s"/>

You breathe into this release...<break time="2.5s"/>
and with your exhale...<break time="2s"/>
something shifts...<break time="2s"/>
loosens...<break time="2s"/>
lets go.<break time="3.5s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The Healer leads you deeper into the workshop...<break time="2.5s"/>
past rows of shimmering mechanisms...<break time="2s"/>
each one a part of your vast inner architecture...<break time="3s"/>
until you come to a place where the light grows warmer...<break time="2.5s"/>
more golden...<break time="2s"/>
and you feel the presence of fire.<break time="3.5s"/>

Here stands another figure...<break time="2s"/>
radiant and strong...<break time="2s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">The Heart Flame Tender</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
dressed in crimson and gold...<break time="2s"/>
eyes blazing with sacred purpose.<break time="3s"/>

At the center of this chamber...<break time="2s"/>
burns a flame unlike any other...<break time="2.5s"/>
not consuming...<break time="2s"/>
but illuminating...<break time="2s"/>
not destroying...<break time="2s"/>
but revealing.<break time="3s"/>

This is the fire of your deepest truth...<break time="2.5s"/>
the flame that has burned since you first drew breath...<break time="2.5s"/>
the light that knows who you truly are.<break time="3.5s"/>

The Flame Tender speaks...<break time="2s"/>
and their voice is both fierce and tender...<break time="3s"/>
"This fire must be tended...<break time="2s"/>
fed with what is authentic...<break time="2s"/>
protected from what is false.<break time="3s"/>
It is time to remember what fuels your soul...<break time="2.5s"/>
and what only creates smoke."<break time="4s"/>

The Tender invites you to step closer to the flame...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you do...<break time="2s"/>
feeling its warmth on your face...<break time="2s"/>
in your heart...<break time="2s"/>
through your entire being.<break time="3s"/>

And in this warmth...<break time="2s"/>
you begin to <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
what truly matters to you...<break time="2.5s"/>
what lights you up from within...<break time="2.5s"/>
what makes your soul sing.<break time="3.5s"/>

You may see images in the flame...<break time="2.5s"/>
or feel sensations...<break time="2s"/>
or simply know...<break time="2s"/>
what this fire is asking you to honor.<break time="4s"/>

And you <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> now...<break time="2.5s"/>
to tend this flame more consciously...<break time="2s"/>
to feed it what is true...<break time="2s"/>
to let it burn away what is not.<break time="4s"/>

The Flame Tender nods...<break time="2s"/>
places a hand over your heart...<break time="2s"/>
and you feel the flame settle there...<break time="2.5s"/>
a pilot light that will never go out...<break time="2.5s"/>
burning steady and bright.<break time="4s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Now the Flame Tender and the Healer both gesture toward a doorway...<break time="2.5s"/>
carved from living wood...<break time="2s"/>
covered in roses of every color...<break time="2.5s"/>
red and white and gold...<break time="2s"/>
their fragrance filling the air...<break time="2s"/>
sweet and deep and complex.<break time="3.5s"/>

You step through this doorway...<break time="2.5s"/>
and enter a garden within the clockwork...<break time="3s"/>
a garden that should not exist here...<break time="2s"/>
yet feels more real than anything you have ever known.<break time="4s"/>

This is the Garden of the Rose Mother.<break time="3.5s"/>

She is here...<break time="2s"/>
waiting...<break time="2s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">The Rose Mother</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
ancient and eternally young...<break time="2s"/>
wearing robes the color of dusk...<break time="2s"/>
her hair woven with roses and moonlight.<break time="3.5s"/>

In her hands she holds a single bloom...<break time="2.5s"/>
perfect and luminous...<break time="2s"/>
and as you look at it...<break time="2s"/>
you realize...<break time="2s"/>
this rose is you.<break time="4s"/>

"Every soul is a rose in my garden," she says softly...<break time="3s"/>
"Each one unique...<break time="2s"/>
each one sacred...<break time="2s"/>
each one unfolding in its own perfect time."<break time="4s"/>

She shows you this rose...<break time="2s"/>
and you can see...<break time="2s"/>
petals that have already opened...<break time="2.5s"/>
revealing beauty and strength...<break time="2s"/>
and petals still curled tight...<break time="2.5s"/>
holding secrets yet to be revealed.<break time="3.5s"/>

"Do not rush your blooming," she whispers...<break time="3s"/>
"Trust the timing of your soul...<break time="2.5s"/>
Trust the seasons of your becoming...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are exactly where you need to be."<break time="4s"/>

She places this luminous rose into your hands...<break time="2.5s"/>
and as you hold it...<break time="2s"/>
you feel its life force...<break time="2s"/>
pulsing in rhythm with your own heartbeat...<break time="3s"/>
and you understand...<break time="2.5s"/>
this is a gift you give yourself...<break time="2.5s"/>
permission to unfold...<break time="2s"/>
permission to become...<break time="2s"/>
permission to <emphasis level="moderate">bloom</emphasis> in your own time.<break time="5s"/>

The Rose Mother smiles...<break time="2s"/>
and the garden begins to shimmer...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you find yourself back in the Workshop...<break time="2.5s"/>
but everything has changed.<break time="3.5s"/>

The clockwork still turns...<break time="2s"/>
but now you can see...<break time="2s"/>
roses growing between the gears...<break time="2.5s"/>
beauty and mechanism intertwined...<break time="2.5s"/>
logic and mystery dancing together.<break time="4s"/>

You understand now...<break time="2.5s"/>
that your unconscious is not separate from your soul...<break time="3s"/>
that your patterns can serve your flowering...<break time="2.5s"/>
that healing and becoming are the same sacred work.<break time="4.5s"/>

The Healer...<break time="2s"/>
the Flame Tender...<break time="2s"/>

stand together now...<break time="2.5s"/>
and speak as one...<break time="3s"/>

We are not separate...<break time="2s"/>
We are aspects of your own deepest self...<break time="3s"/>

You bow in gratitude...<break time="2s"/>
and as you do...<break time="2s"/>
you feel yourself beginning to rise...<break time="2.5s"/>
gently...<break time="2s"/>
naturally...<break time="2s"/>
like a diver ascending through clear water.<break time="3.5s"/>

The workshop fades...<break time="2s"/>

woven into the fabric of your being...<break time="3s"/>
patterns that will continue to work...<break time="2s"/>

healing that will deepen...<break time="2s"/>
