You remain in complete control throughout this experience...<break time="2s"/> At any time, you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="2s"/> simply by opening your eyes or shifting your attention...<break time="2.5s"/> You remain fully aware and in control...<break time="2s"/> and only suggestions that serve your highest good are invited...<break time="2.5s"/>
Find a comfortable position...<break time="2s"/> seated or lying down...<break time="2s"/> allow your spine to be supported...<break time="2s"/> and if possible, wear headphones and make sure you will not be disturbed...<break time="2.5s"/> You choose, in your own time, how deeply you wish to explore...<break time="2.5s"/> You decide, in your own way, how far you go...<break time="2.5s"/> and your discernment remains strong and clear...<break time="2.5s"/>

And as you prepare...<break time="2s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how easily you <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/> how naturally you <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> insight...<break time="2.5s"/> and how gently you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> this experience to unfold...<break time="3s"/></prosody>

As you breathe...<break time="2s"/> you may <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a quiet rhythm...<break time="2s"/> the gentle cadence of your breath...<break time="2s"/> your mind entering that theta state of deep creativity...<break time="2.5s"/> where images begin to form on their own...<break time="2.5s"/> You are not forcing...<break time="2s"/> you are <emphasis level="moderate">receiving</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
If you wish...<break time="1.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> any tension with each exhale...<break time="2.5s"/> and if a thought passes through...<break time="2s"/> simply let it drift...<break time="2s"/> like a cloud in a calm sky...<break time="2.5s"/> You choose to go deeper, in your own time...<break time="2.5s"/> as feels right to you...<break time="2.5s"/>

  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  [SFX: Spacious wind chimes, distant river, 5s decay]
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">In your mind's eye...<break time="2s"/> a gentle horizon appears...<break time="2.5s"/> a luminous valley where earth and sky meet...<break time="3s"/> The air is clear and cool...<break time="2s"/> carrying the scent of pine and fresh rain...<break time="2.5s"/> Beneath your feet, the ground is soft and springy...<break time="2.5s"/> and above you, a canopy of starlight shimmers like a living tapestry...<break time="3s"/>
You are aware of your body here...<break time="2s"/> the steady pulse in your chest...<break time="2s"/> the warmth in your hands...<break time="2s"/> the gentle touch of a breeze on your skin...<break time="2.5s"/> You taste cool, crystalline water on your lips...<break time="2s"/> and hear a soft hum, like a distant choir of light...<break time="2.5s"/> and in this sacred landscape...<break time="2s"/> your neural pathways begin to <emphasis level="moderate">rewire</emphasis> with each calm breath...<break time="3s"/>
Ahead, you notice a path of glowing stones...<break time="2s"/> each one a gentle, warm light under your steps...<break time="2.5s"/> As you walk...<break time="2s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> your attention to expand...<break time="2.5s"/> noticing colors in the air...<break time="2s"/> soft blues and golds...<break time="2s"/> delicate spirals like the Flower of Life...<break time="2.5s"/> and a feeling of being guided by wisdom that serves your highest good...<break time="3s"/>
In the distance...<break time="2s"/> a vast tree rises...<break time="2.5s"/> the World Tree...<break time="2s"/> a living symbol of rooted strength and branching possibility...<break time="2.5s"/> Its bark is etched with luminous patterns...<break time="2s"/> and its leaves shimmer like emerald glass...<break time="2.5s"/> You sense the World Tree Guardian...<break time="2s"/> as a psychological metaphor...<break time="2s"/> representing your inner stability and life force...<break time="2.5s"/> inviting your compassionate attention...<break time="3s"/>
As you approach...<break time="2s"/> you notice a warm glow at the base of the tree...<break time="2.5s"/> a pool of healing light...<break time="2.5s"/> You choose, in your own time, to place your hands above the light...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you do...<break time="2s"/> you may <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a gentle tingling...<break time="2s"/> a warmth that spreads from your palms...<break time="2s"/> through your arms...<break time="2s"/> into your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
With each breath...<break time="2s"/> you <emphasis level="moderate">draw</emphasis> in light...<break time="2.5s"/> and with each exhale...<break time="2s"/> you <emphasis level="moderate">send</emphasis> that light into your body...<break time="2.5s"/> Colors breathe with your inhale...<break time="2s"/> light shimmers with your exhale...<break time="2s"/> and shapes soften into view...<break time="3s"/> You sense your body as a resonance field...<break time="2s"/> a sacred instrument...<break time="2.5s"/> tuned to peace, to healing, to wholeness...<break time="3s"/>
And now...<break time="2s"/> a gentle figure appears at the tree's side...<break time="2.5s"/> The Great Physician...<break time="2s"/> a symbolic mirror of your inner healing intelligence...<break time="2.5s"/> a psychological metaphor for restoration, wisdom, and care...<break time="3s"/> You do not surrender your will...<break time="2s"/> you remain fully aware...<break time="2s"/> and choose, in your own way, to receive the gift of insight...<break time="3s"/>
The Great Physician holds a bowl of luminous water...<break time="2s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to sip...<break time="2.5s"/> tasting cool, sweet clarity...<break time="2s"/> and as the water flows...<break time="2s"/> you <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what no longer serves...<break time="2.5s"/> old fatigue, old tension, old habits...<break time="2.5s"/> dissolving into light...<break time="3s"/>
Now you notice...<break time="2s"/> a sacred light forming between your hands...<break time="2.5s"/> a radiant sphere...<break time="2s"/> warm and humming...<break time="2.5s"/> It grows with each breath...<break time="2s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">increase</emphasis> its brightness...<break time="2.5s"/> as feels right to you...<break time="2.5s"/> You decide how strong it becomes...<break time="2.5s"/> and your discernment guides you...<break time="2.5s"/>
You may notice the Guardian Father now...<break time="2s"/> a symbolic protector...<break time="2s"/> representing your inner strength and benevolent guidance...<break time="2.5s"/> His presence feels like a steady hand on your shoulder...<break time="2.5s"/> a quiet assurance...<break time="2s"/> that you are safe...<break time="2s"/> supported...<break time="2s"/> and free...<break time="2.5s"/>
And in the light of this sacred tree...<break time="2s"/> you are rooted in Christ's love...<break time="2.5s"/> held in a mercy that strengthens discernment and wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/> Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time="2.5s"/> steady, unwavering, compassionate...<break time="3s"/>
Now...<break time="2s"/> allow the sphere of light to expand...<break time="2.5s"/> until it fills your chest...<break time="2s"/> your arms...<break time="2s"/> your belly...<break time="2s"/> your legs...<break time="2s"/> and your entire body...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how your body responds...<break time="2s"/> warmth...<break time="2s"/> soft vibration...<break time="2s"/> a soothing hum...<break time="2.5s"/> and a feeling of being repaired...<break time="2.5s"/>
And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>
You can choose to go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/> or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/> and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="1.5s"/> simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>
In this dream realm...<break time="2s"/> you practice manifesting light...<break time="2s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">shape</emphasis> it as you choose...<break time="2.5s"/> Perhaps you create a ribbon of gold...<break time="2s"/> and let it weave through your body...<break time="2.5s"/> or a cool stream of blue light...<break time="2s"/> washing through your mind...<break time="2.5s"/> or a soft rose glow...<break time="2s"/> that settles around your heart...<break time="2.5s"/> Notice the colors that appear to you...<break time="2.5s"/> and how they feel...<break time="3s"/>
You remember...<break time="2s"/> that this light is a symbol...<break time="2s"/> a metaphor for your God-given capacity to heal and renew...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> your own wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/> as insights arise...<break time="2.5s"/> Your mind remains clear...<break time="2s"/> your will engaged...<break time="2.5s"/> and your heart steady...<break time="2.5s"/>
As you stand by the World Tree...<break time="2s"/> you see sacred geometry unfolding...<break time="2.5s"/> spirals within spirals...<break time="2.5s"/> a mandala opening...<break time="2.5s"/> and you hear a soft chime...<break time="2s"/> as if the tree itself is singing...<break time="2.5s"/> The air carries the scent of cedar and myrrh...<break time="2.5s"/> and the taste of honeyed water lingers on your tongue...<break time="2.5s"/>
Now...<break time="2s"/> imagine a place in your body or life that longs for healing...<break time="2s"/> and without forcing...<break time="2s"/> simply allow light to flow there...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">send</emphasis> warmth...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">soothe</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">restore</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">renew</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/> as feels right to you...<break time="3s"/>
And as you do...<break time="2s"/> you may notice subtle shifts...<break time="2s"/> a loosening...<break time="2s"/> a softening...<break time="2s"/> a gentle release...<break time="2.5s"/> your energy rebalancing...<break time="2.5s"/> your nervous system settling...<break time="2.5s"/> and your mind aligning with peace...<break time="2.5s"/> Your neural pathways continue to rewire...<break time="2.5s"/> your body remembering how to heal...<break time="3s"/>
Now, receive a symbolic gift...<break time="2s"/> a small crystal of light...<break time="2.5s"/> cool and clear in your hand...<break time="2.5s"/> It represents your capacity to manifest healing energy...<break time="2.5s"/> and whenever you recall it...<break time="2s"/> your body remembers this calm...<break time="2.5s"/> this clarity...<break time="2.5s"/> this gentle power...<break time="3s"/>
And here, by the World Tree...<break time="2s"/> you can sense the roots below...<break time="2.5s"/> deep into the earth...<break time="2.5s"/> and the branches above...<break time="2.5s"/> reaching into the heavens...<break time="2.5s"/> reminding you that healing flows both ways...<break time="2.5s"/> from ground to sky...<break time="2.5s"/> from breath to light...<break time="3s"/>
Before you return...<break time="2s"/> take a final moment to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/> how your body feels...<break time="2.5s"/> how your heart feels...<break time="2.5s"/> how your mind feels...<break time="2.5s"/> and allow gratitude to rise...<break time="2.5s"/> gratitude for your own wisdom...<break time="2.5s"/> and for the healing light that is always available to you...<break time="3s"/>
And in the days ahead...<break time="1s"/> hours...<break time="1s"/> and even minutes...<break time="1.5s"/> you may notice this light continuing to glow...<break time="3s"/> a gentle radiance guiding your choices...<break time="3s"/> steady and true...<break time="3s"/></prosody>
