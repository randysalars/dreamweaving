Welcome.<break time="2s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="1.5s"/> you are invited on a sacred journey...<break time="2s"/> to a place that stands eternal...<break time="2s"/> at the edge of the vast ocean of possibility...<break time="3s"/>

This is the Lighthouse of Commitment...<break time="2.5s"/> where the flame of your deepest promises burns bright...<break time="2s"/> and the light of your truest heart illuminates the path ahead.<break time="3s"/>

You remain in complete control throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/> At any time...<break time="1s"/> you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="2s"/> simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/> perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="1.5s"/> or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="3s"/>

Allow your eyes to close when you are ready...<break time="2.5s"/> and take a deep...<break time="1s"/> nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/> breathing in possibility...<break time="2s"/> and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

You are held in love throughout this journey...<break time="2s"/> guided by wisdom that serves your highest good...<break time="2.5s"/> as you explore the sacred architecture of commitment...<break time="2s"/> and tend the eternal flame of your word.<break time="3.5s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/> bring your awareness to your breath...<break time="2.5s"/> noticing the gentle rhythm...<break time="2s"/> that has been with you all your life.<break time="3s"/>

Breathe in deeply for a count of four...<break time="4s"/> hold gently for four...<break time="4s"/> and exhale slowly for six...<break time="6s"/>

Now allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm...<break time="2s"/> as you begin to <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/> more deeply than you have in a very long time.<break time="3.5s"/>

Starting at the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/> feel a warm...<break time="1.5s"/> golden light beginning to glow...<break time="2.5s"/> soft and gentle...<break time="2s"/> like candlelight in a sacred space.<break time="3s"/>

This warmth begins to travel down...<break time="2s"/> melting through your forehead...<break time="2s"/> releasing the tiny muscles around your eyes...<break time="2.5s"/> softening your jaw...<break time="2s"/> and flowing down your neck...<break time="2s"/> like honey...<break time="2s"/> like liquid gold.<break time="3.5s"/>

Your shoulders <emphasis level="moderate">drop</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/> heavy and peaceful...<break time="2s"/> as the warmth flows down your arms...<break time="2s"/> all the way to your fingertips...<break time="3s"/> which may begin to tingle...<break time="2s"/> with a pleasant...<break time="1.5s"/> surrendering sensation.<break time="3.5s"/>

The golden light continues down...<break time="2s"/> through your chest...<break time="2s"/> warming your heart center...<break time="2.5s"/> down through your belly...<break time="2s"/> your hips...<break time="2s"/> your thighs...<break time="3s"/>

Flowing like a river of peace...<break time="2s"/> down your calves...<break time="2s"/> your ankles...<break time="2s"/> and into the soles of your feet...<break time="3s"/> grounding you...<break time="2s"/> earthing you...<break time="2s"/> anchoring you in this safe...<break time="1.5s"/> sacred space.<break time="4s"/>

Ten...<break time="2s"/> drifting down now...<break time="2s"/> like a feather on the ocean breeze.<break time="3s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now...<break time="2.5s"/> you find yourself standing on a wild coastal cliff...<break time="3s"/> at twilight.<break time="3.5s"/>

The sky above is painted in deep purples and blues...<break time="2.5s"/> the last golden light of the sun kissing the horizon...<break time="2.5s"/> where the vast ocean meets the endless sky.<break time="3.5s"/>

The air is cool and fresh...<break time="2s"/> carrying the salt and mineral scent of the sea...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can taste it...<break time="2s"/> clean and alive...<break time="2s"/> on your lips.<break time="3.5s"/>

Beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/> wild grass and sea thyme...<break time="2s"/> soft and springy...<break time="2s"/> anchoring you to the earth.<break time="3.5s"/>

And ahead of you...<break time="2.5s"/> standing tall and eternal...<break time="2s"/> rises the Lighthouse of Commitment.<break time="4s"/>

Its white stone tower glows softly in the fading light...<break time="2.5s"/> ancient and beautiful...<break time="2s"/> weathered by countless storms...<break time="2s"/> yet standing firm...<break time="2s"/> unshaken.<break time="3.5s"/>

At the very top...<break time="2s"/> you see it...<break time="2.5s"/> a warm...<break time="1.5s"/> golden flame...<break time="2s"/> burning steady and bright...<break time="2.5s"/> sending its light out across the dark waters.<break time="4s"/>

This is your flame...<break time="2.5s"/> the light of your deepest commitments...<break time="2.5s"/> the promises you have made to yourself...<break time="2s"/> and to others...<break time="2s"/> and to life itself.<break time="4s"/>

You begin to walk toward the lighthouse...<break time="2.5s"/> and as you do...<break time="2s"/> a figure appears at the entrance...<break time="3s"/> waiting for you with infinite patience.<break time="3.5s"/>

It is the Lighthouse Keeper...<break time="2.5s"/> the Inner Healer...<break time="2s"/> cloaked in soft grey robes...<break time="2s"/> eyes kind and knowing...<break time="2.5s"/> holding a lantern of rose-gold light.<break time="4s"/>

"Welcome,"<break time="1.5s"/> the Keeper says softly.<break time="2.5s"/> "I have been tending your flame...<break time="2s"/> waiting for you to return."<break time="3.5s"/>

The Keeper gestures toward the entrance...<break time="2s"/> a weathered wooden door...<break time="2s"/> warm to the touch...<break time="2s"/> and you step inside.<break time="3.5s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Inside...<break time="2s"/> the lighthouse is filled with soft...<break time="1.5s"/> amber light...<break time="2.5s"/> and the air smells of beeswax candles...<break time="2s"/> old wood...<break time="2s"/> and sea salt.<break time="3.5s"/>

A spiral staircase winds upward...<break time="2.5s"/> carved from smooth stone...<break time="2s"/> each step worn by centuries of pilgrims...<break time="2.5s"/> each one coming here to tend their flame.<break time="4s"/>

"Come,"<break time="1.5s"/> says the Keeper.<break time="2s"/> "Let us <emphasis level="moderate">ascend</emphasis> together."<break time="3.5s"/>

And you begin to climb...<break time="3s"/> one step at a time...<break time="2.5s"/> feeling the coolness of the stone beneath your feet...<break time="2.5s"/> your hand trailing along the spiral wall...<break time="3s"/> as you rise...<break time="2s"/> higher and higher...<break time="2.5s"/> toward the source of the light.<break time="4s"/>

With each step...<break time="2s"/> you feel your heart opening...<break time="2.5s"/> your breath deepening...<break time="2s"/> and a sense of purpose...<break time="2s"/> ancient and true...<break time="2s"/> stirring within you.<break time="4s"/>

Finally...<break time="2.5s"/> you reach the top chamber...<break time="3s"/> and step into a circular room of breathtaking beauty.<break time="4s"/>

The walls are glass...<break time="2s"/> offering a three-hundred-sixty-degree view of the ocean...<break time="2.5s"/> the stars beginning to appear above...<break time="2s"/> the moonlight shimmering on the water below.<break time="4s"/>

And at the center...<break time="2.5s"/> stands the great lamp...<break time="3s"/> its flame burning golden and steady...<break time="2.5s"/> casting rays of light out into the night.<break time="4s"/>

"This is the flame of your commitments,"<break time="2s"/> the Keeper says.<break time="3s"/> "Every promise you have ever made...<break time="2.5s"/> lives here as light."<break time="4s"/>

And as you gaze into the flame...<break time="2.5s"/> you begin to <emphasis level="moderate">see</emphasis> them...<break time="3s"/> the faces...<break time="2s"/> the moments...<break time="2s"/> the vows spoken in your heart.<break time="4s"/>

Commitments to love...<break time="2s"/> to create...<break time="2s"/> to heal...<break time="2s"/> to grow.<break time="3s"/>

Promises to show up...<break time="2s"/> to be faithful...<break time="2s"/> to keep going...<break time="2s"/> even when it was hard.<break time="4s"/>

Some flames burn bright and strong...<break time="2.5s"/> well-tended...<break time="2s"/> honored.<break time="3s"/>

Others flicker...<break time="2s"/> starved for attention...<break time="2s"/> waiting to be remembered.<break time="4s"/>

And now...<break time="2.5s"/> another presence enters the chamber...<break time="3s"/> radiant and tender.<break time="3.5s"/>

It is the Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2.5s"/> robed in crimson and gold...<break time="2.5s"/> carrying a vessel of sacred oil...<break time="2.5s"/> and beside her...<break time="2s"/> the Rose Mother...<break time="2.5s"/> her arms filled with wild roses...<break time="2s"/> their fragrance filling the air...<break time="2s"/> sweet and ancient.<break time="4s"/>

"We are here to help you,"<break time="2s"/> they say together.<break time="3s"/> "To <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> to <emphasis level="moderate">renew</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> to <emphasis level="moderate">recommit</emphasis>."<break time="4.5s"/>

The Heart Flame Tender approaches the lamp...<break time="2.5s"/> and pours the sacred oil into the reservoir...<break time="3s"/> and immediately...<break time="2s"/> the flame burns brighter...<break time="2s"/> stronger...<break time="2s"/> more brilliant.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother lays the roses at the base of the lamp...<break time="2.5s"/> and their petals glow...<break time="2s"/> catching the light...<break time="2s"/> becoming living jewels of red and pink and white.<break time="4s"/>

"Which commitment calls to you now?"<break time="2s"/> the Keeper asks softly.<break time="3s"/> "Which flame needs tending?"<break time="4s"/>

And you know.<break time="3s"/>

You know the promise that has been waiting...<break time="2.5s"/> the vow you made long ago...<break time="2.5s"/> or the one you are ready to make now.<break time="4s"/>

Perhaps it is a commitment to yourself...<break time="2.5s"/> to your health...<break time="2s"/> to your creativity...<break time="2s"/> to your sacred worth.<break time="4s"/>

Perhaps it is a promise to another...<break time="2.5s"/> to love deeply...<break time="2s"/> to listen truly...<break time="2s"/> to walk beside them with patience and grace.<break time="4s"/>

Or perhaps...<break time="2s"/> it is a commitment to something larger than yourself...<break time="2.5s"/> to the earth...<break time="2s"/> to beauty...<break time="2s"/> to truth...<break time="2s"/> to the sacred work that is yours alone to do.<break time="5s"/>

Speak it now...<break time="2.5s"/> silently in your heart...<break time="3s"/> or aloud if you wish.<break time="4s"/>

Name the commitment you are here to tend.<break time="5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And as you name it...<break time="2.5s"/> the flame responds.<break time="3.5s"/>

It flares...<break time="2s"/> golden and radiant...<break time="2s"/> and a beam of light shoots out from the lighthouse...<break time="2.5s"/> out over the dark ocean...<break time="2.5s"/> illuminating the path ahead.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother steps forward...<break time="2.5s"/> and places a single rose in your hands...<break time="3s"/> warm and alive...<break time="2s"/> its petals soft as silk...<break time="2s"/> its fragrance a promise of beauty even in the wildest storm.<break time="4.5s"/>

"Carry this with you,"<break time="2s"/> she whispers.<break time="3s"/> "A reminder that commitment is not rigid...<break time="2.5s"/> it is alive...<break time="2s"/> rooted in love...<break time="2s"/> blooming in tenderness."<break time="4.5s"/>

The Heart Flame Tender anoints your forehead with the sacred oil...<break time="3s"/> warm and fragrant...<break time="2s"/> and you feel a spark ignite within you...<break time="2.5s"/> in your own heart center...<break time="2.5s"/> a flame that mirrors the great lamp before you.<break time="4.5s"/>

"You are the keeper of your own flame now,"<break time="2.5s"/> the Tender says.<break time="3s"/> "Tend it with devotion...<break time="2s"/> feed it with action...<break time="2s"/> protect it with boundaries...<break time="2s"/> and let it light the way home."<break time="5s"/>

You stand there...<break time="2.5s"/> surrounded by these sacred guides...<break time="2.5s"/> holding the rose...<break time="2s"/> feeling the warmth of the flame within and before you...<break time="3s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">know</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/> deeply and truly...<break time="2.5s"/> what it means to make a promise...<break time="2.5s"/> and keep it.<break time="4.5s"/>

Not out of obligation...<break time="2.5s"/> but out of love.<break time="3s"/>

Not out of fear...<break time="2.5s"/> but out of freedom.<break time="3.5s"/>

Commitment as a lighthouse...<break time="2.5s"/> not a cage.<break time="3s"/>

A light to guide you through the dark...<break time="2.5s"/> a structure to hold you steady...<break time="2.5s"/> a flame that warms and never burns.<break time="5s"/>

"Carry the light with you,"<break time="2s"/> the Keeper says.<break time="3s"/> "It is yours...<break time="2s"/> now and always."<break time="4s"/>

You bow in gratitude...<break time="2.5s"/> to the Keeper...<break time="2s"/> to the Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2s"/> to the Rose Mother...<break time="3s"/> and you <emphasis level="moderate">descend</emphasis> the spiral stairs...<break time="3s"/> one step at a time...<break time="2.5s"/> returning to the base of the lighthouse.<break time="4s"/>

As you step outside...<break time="2.5s"/> the night air is cool and alive...<break time="2.5s"/> and the beam of light from the lighthouse sweeps across the ocean...<break time="3s"/> steady and sure...<break time="2s"/> guiding all who sail these waters home.<break time="4.5s"/>
