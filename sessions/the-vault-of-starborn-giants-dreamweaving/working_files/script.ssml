Welcome.<break time="2s"/>

In the next thirty minutes, you are invited on a journey into a sacred mystery...<break time="2s"/> a mythic vault hidden deep within the earth...<break time="2s"/> where ancient giants born of starlight once walked.<break time="3s"/>

You remain in complete control throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/> At any time, you can return to full waking awareness simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/> You are completely safe...<break time="1.5s"/> held in Christ's unwavering love...<break time="2s"/> and guided by wisdom that serves your highest good.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/> perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported, or lying down where your body can fully relax.<break time="2.5s"/> Wear headphones if possible, so the journey can wrap around you completely.<break time="2.5s"/> Ensure you will not be disturbed for the next half hour.<break time="3s"/>

This journey will take you deep into the earth...<break time="2s"/> into a forgotten vault where three great beings await...<break time="2.5s"/> the Inner Healer who mends what is broken...<break time="2s"/> the World Tree Guardian who connects heaven and earth...<break time="2s"/> and the Rose Mother who offers beauty and grace.<break time="3s"/>

These are not literal spirits, but psychological metaphors...<break time="2s"/> representing aspects of your own inner wisdom...<break time="2s"/> that invite your compassionate attention.<break time="3s"/>

Allow yourself to <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> whatever insights come naturally.<break time="2.5s"/> You choose, in your own time...<break time="1.5s"/> how deeply you wish to explore.<break time="3s"/>

When you are ready...<break time="2s"/> allow your eyes to close.<break time="3s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/> take a deep, nourishing breath in...<break time="3s"/> breathing in peace...<break time="2s"/> and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

Breathe in for four...<break time="4s"/> hold gently for four...<break time="4s"/> and exhale for six...<break time="6s"/>

Again...<break time="2s"/> in for four...<break time="4s"/> hold...<break time="4s"/> and out for six...<break time="6s"/>

And as you breathe...<break time="2s"/> you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> how naturally your body knows how to <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>

Starting at the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> a wave of softness to begin...<break time="2.5s"/> a gentle warmth...<break time="2s"/> flowing down across your forehead...<break time="2s"/> smoothing away any tension there.<break time="3s"/>

This warmth flows around your eyes...<break time="2s"/> your cheeks...<break time="2s"/> your jaw softening...<break time="2s"/> your tongue resting gently in your mouth.<break time="3s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="2s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go.<break time="4s"/>

The warmth flows down your neck...<break time="2s"/> across your shoulders...<break time="2s"/> releasing...<break time="2s"/> releasing...<break time="2s"/> releasing.<break time="3s"/>

Down your arms...<break time="2s"/> into your hands...<break time="2s"/> your fingers softening completely.<break time="3s"/>

Across your chest...<break time="2s"/> feeling your heart beating steadily...<break time="2s"/> your breath rising and falling like gentle waves.<break time="3s"/>

Down through your abdomen...<break time="2s"/> your lower back...<break time="2s"/> your hips releasing into the surface beneath you.<break time="3s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/> I'm going to count from ten down to one...<break time="2s"/> and with each number...<break time="1.5s"/> you drift deeper...<break time="2s"/> more relaxed...<break time="2s"/> more open.<break time="3s"/>

Ten...<break time="1.5s"/> sinking deeper.<break time="2s"/>
Nine...<break time="1.5s"/> letting go.<break time="2s"/>
Eight...<break time="1.5s"/> releasing completely.<break time="2s"/>
Seven...<break time="1.5s"/> deeper still.<break time="2s"/>
Six...<break time="1.5s"/> calm and peaceful.<break time="2s"/>
Five...<break time="1.5s"/> halfway there.<break time="2s"/>
Four...<break time="1.5s"/> drifting further down.<break time="2s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/> you find yourself standing at the entrance to a great cavern...<break time="2.5s"/> a doorway carved into the living rock of an ancient mountain.<break time="3s"/>

The air here is cool...<break time="2s"/> and you can smell the mineral scent of deep earth...<break time="2s"/> damp stone...<break time="2s"/> and something else...<break time="2s"/> something faintly luminous...<break time="2s"/> like starlight concentrated into fragrance.<break time="3s"/>

Before you, stone steps descend into darkness...<break time="2.5s"/> but at the edges of your vision...<break time="2s"/> you notice a soft, silvery glow emanating from below.<break time="3s"/>

You choose to descend.<break time="3s"/>

Step by step...<break time="2s"/> feeling the cool stone beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/> solid and ancient...<break time="2s"/> you walk downward into the earth.<break time="3s"/>

One step...<break time="1s"/> two steps...<break time="1s"/> three...<break time="2s"/>

The light grows brighter around you...<break time="2s"/> not harsh, but gentle...<break time="2s"/> like moonlight filtered through water.<break time="3s"/>

Seven steps...<break time="1s"/> eight...<break time="1s"/> nine...<break time="2s"/>

And you can hear it now...<break time="2s"/> a low, resonant hum...<break time="2.5s"/> vibrating up through the stone...<break time="2s"/> through your feet...<break time="2s"/> into your bones.<break time="3s"/>

Twelve steps...<break time="1s"/> thirteen...<break time="1s"/> and you arrive.<break time="4s"/>

[SFX: Crystal chime, ethereal, cascading tones, 5 seconds with shimmer]

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Before you stretches a vast underground chamber...<break time="2.5s"/> a vault carved from living crystal and stone.<break time="3s"/>

The ceiling rises hundreds of feet above you...<break time="2s"/> studded with veins of luminous mineral...<break time="2s"/> glowing with soft blue and silver light...<break time="2s"/> like stars frozen in the rock.<break time="3s"/>

The walls are covered in carvings...<break time="2s"/> ancient symbols...<break time="2s"/> spirals and geometric patterns...<break time="2s"/> the language of a people forgotten by time.<break time="3s"/>

And in the center of this vast chamber...<break time="2s"/> you see three enormous thrones...<break time="2.5s"/> each carved from a single piece of stone...<break time="2s"/> and upon each throne...<break time="2s"/> a figure sits.<break time="4s"/>

These are the Starborn Giants.<break time="3s"/>

They are vast...<break time="2s"/> towering...<break time="2s"/> yet their presence does not frighten you.<break time="2.5s"/> Instead, you feel welcomed...<break time="2s"/> expected...<break time="2s"/> as though you have been awaited for a very long time.<break time="4s"/>

The first figure rises slowly from the leftmost throne.<break time="3s"/>

This is the Inner Healer...<break time="2s"/> a psychological metaphor representing the part of you that knows how to mend...<break time="2s"/> how to restore...<break time="2s"/> how to make whole what has been broken.<break time="3s"/>

The Healer's form is draped in robes that shimmer like water...<break time="2s"/> shifting between deep indigo and soft silver.<break time="2.5s"/> In one hand, the Healer holds a glowing vessel...<break time="2s"/> filled with light that pulses like a heartbeat.<break time="3s"/>

The Healer steps toward you...<break time="2s"/> and as you watch...<break time="2s"/> you notice what color this light becomes for you.<break time="4s"/>

Perhaps it is gold...<break time="2s"/> or emerald...<break time="2s"/> or rose...<break time="2s"/> or a color you have never seen before.<break time="3s"/>

The Healer kneels before you...<break time="2s"/> vast yet gentle...<break time="2s"/> and lifts the vessel to your chest.<break time="3s"/>

You feel warmth spreading from your heart...<break time="2s"/> radiating outward...<break time="2s"/> touching every part of your body...<break time="2s"/> every memory...<break time="2s"/> every wound.<break time="3s"/>

And in this warmth...<break time="2s"/> something begins to <emphasis level="moderate">mend</emphasis>.<break time="3s"/>

Not with force, but with patience.<break time="2s"/> Not by erasing, but by <emphasis level="moderate">integrating</emphasis>.<break time="3s"/>

You <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> this healing to unfold...<break time="2s"/> in your own time...<break time="2s"/> in your own way.<break time="4s"/>
</prosody>

[SFX: Low resonant bowl tone, warm and sustained, 6 seconds with gentle fade]

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The Healer nods...<break time="2s"/> and returns to the throne.<break time="3s"/>

Now the second figure stands...<break time="2s"/> from the center throne.<break time="3s"/>

This is the World Tree Guardian...<break time="2.5s"/> an aspect of yourself that connects heaven and earth...<break time="2s"/> roots and branches...<break time="2s"/> the seen and the unseen.<break time="3s"/>

The Guardian is tall beyond measure...<break time="2s"/> robed in bark and moss and living green...<break time="2.5s"/> with a staff carved from ancient wood...<break time="2s"/> wrapped in spiraling vines that bloom with tiny white flowers.<break time="3s"/>

As the Guardian approaches...<break time="2s"/> you feel the ground beneath you shift slightly...<break time="2s"/> and you realize that roots...<break time="2s"/> vast roots...<break time="2s"/> run beneath this entire vault.<break time="3s"/>

The Guardian touches the staff to the ground...<break time="2s"/> and suddenly you can see them...<break time="2.5s"/> luminous roots spreading out in every direction...<break time="2s"/> pulsing with life...<break time="2s"/> connecting this chamber to the entire mountain...<break time="2s"/> to the forests above...<break time="2s"/> to the rivers...<break time="2s"/> to the sky.<break time="4s"/>

And you realize...<break time="2s"/> you are connected too.<break time="3s"/>

You are not separate from this web of life...<break time="2.5s"/> you are woven into it...<break time="2s"/> part of something vast and beautiful and ancient.<break time="3s"/>

The Guardian places one enormous hand above your head...<break time="2s"/> not touching, but hovering...<break time="2s"/> and you feel energy flowing...<break time="2s"/> down from the heavens through the Guardian's form...<break time="2s"/> into your crown...<break time="2s"/> down through your spine...<break time="2s"/> into the earth beneath your feet.<break time="3s"/>

You are a bridge...<break time="2s"/> connecting worlds...<break time="2s"/> carrying light downward...<break time="2s"/> and stability upward.<break time="4s"/>

And in this connection...<break time="2s"/> you feel a deep sense of belonging.<break time="4s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The Guardian bows...<break time="2s"/> and returns to the throne.<break time="3s"/>

And now the third figure rises...<break time="2s"/> from the rightmost throne.<break time="3s"/>

This is the Rose Mother...<break time="2.5s"/> the part of you that knows beauty...<break time="2s"/> that offers grace...<break time="2s"/> that nurtures with gentle strength.<break time="3s"/>

She is clothed in petals...<break time="2s"/> layers and layers of rose petals in every shade...<break time="2s"/> from deep crimson to soft blush to pure white.<break time="3s"/>

Her face is kind...<break time="2s"/> ageless...<break time="2s"/> and her eyes hold the warmth of a thousand sunrises.<break time="3s"/>

As she approaches...<break time="2s"/> you smell the fragrance...<break time="2s"/> roses, yes...<break time="2s"/> but also honey...<break time="2s"/> and warm bread...<break time="2s"/> and summer rain.<break time="3s"/>

The Rose Mother reaches into her robe...<break time="2s"/> and draws out a single bloom...<break time="2.5s"/> perfect and luminous...<break time="2s"/> and offers it to you.<break time="3s"/>

As you take it...<break time="2s"/> it transforms in your hands...<break time="2.5s"/> becoming something only you can see.<break time="3s"/>

Perhaps it becomes a key...<break time="2s"/> or a seed...<break time="2s"/> or a star...<break time="2s"/> or it remains a rose.<break time="3s"/>

Whatever it is...<break time="2s"/> you know this is a gift meant specifically for you.<break time="3s"/>

The Rose Mother leans close...<break time="2s"/> and whispers something...<break time="2.5s"/> words only you can hear...<break time="3s"/> a message that will continue unfolding in the days ahead.<break time="4s"/>

And you feel something open in your chest...<break time="2s"/> a softness...<break time="2s"/> a willingness to <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> beauty...<break time="2s"/> to accept grace...<break time="2s"/> to be held in love.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother smiles...<break time="2s"/> and returns to her throne.<break time="3s"/>

All three Starborn Giants sit now...<break time="2.5s"/> watching you with warmth and patience.<break time="3s"/>

And you understand...<break time="2s"/> that these are not external beings...<break time="2s"/> but mirrors...<break time="2s"/> reflecting aspects of your own soul...<break time="2s"/> your own inner wisdom.<break time="3s"/>

The Healer within you...<break time="2s"/> the Guardian within you...<break time="2s"/> the Mother within you...<break time="2s"/> all awake now...<break time="2s"/> all available to you.<break time="4s"/>

You place your hand on your heart...<break time="2s"/> and you feel the warmth there...<break time="2s"/> the connection...<break time="2s"/> the grace.<break time="3s"/>

Step by step, ascending...<break time="2s"/> feeling the stone beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/> solid and real.<break time="3s"/>

The giants remain...<break time="2s"/> patient and eternal...<break time="2s"/> always available within you.<break time="4s"/>
