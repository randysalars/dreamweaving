Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
I'm so glad you're here.<break time="2.5s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="1.5s"/>
you're invited on a journey...<break time="2s"/>
a sacred path-working into the realm of<break time="1s"/>
extravagant self-expression...<break time="2.5s"/>
radical authenticity...<break time="2s"/>
and the luminous courage<break time="1s"/>
to reveal your truest colors to the world.<break time="3s"/>

You remain completely safe...<break time="2s"/>
fully in control...<break time="2s"/>
able to return to normal awareness<break time="1s"/>
at any moment you choose.<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Soft crystalline chime, shimmering, 3 seconds with gentle decay]

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="2s"/>
or lying down with your body fully relaxed.<break time="3s"/>

Allow your eyes to close when you're ready...<break time="2.5s"/>
and take a deep...<break time="1s"/>
nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/>

Breathing in possibility...<break time="2.5s"/>
and breathing out<break time="1s"/>
anything you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

This journey will guide you into a theater of transformation...<break time="2s"/>
where the archetypal energies of<break time="1s"/>
the Inner Healer...<break time="1.5s"/>
the Rose Mother...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the Heart Flame Tender<break time="1s"/>
await to help you remember<break time="2s"/>
the magnificent truth of who you are.<break time="4s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And so we begin...<break time="3s"/>

Breathe in deeply through your nose...<break time="2s"/>
for a count of four...<break time="4s"/>
Hold gently...<break time="4s"/>
And exhale slowly through your mouth...<break time="2s"/>
for a count of six...<break time="6s"/>

Again...<break time="2s"/>
breathing in<break time="1s"/>
one...<break time="1s"/>
two...<break time="1s"/>
three...<break time="1s"/>
four...<break time="3s"/>

And releasing<break time="1s"/>
one...<break time="1s"/>
two...<break time="1s"/>
three...<break time="1s"/>
four...<break time="1s"/>
five...<break time="1s"/>
six...<break time="4s"/>

[SFX: Gentle ocean waves, distant, soft ambient wash, continuous 30 seconds]

Notice how your breath<break time="1.5s"/>
carries you deeper...<break time="2.5s"/>
with each gentle cycle...<break time="3s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
bring your awareness to the crown of your head...<break time="2.5s"/>
and imagine a warm...<break time="1.5s"/>
golden light<break time="1s"/>
beginning to pour down...<break time="3s"/>

This light softens your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
smooths the space between your brows...<break time="2.5s"/>
relaxes the tiny muscles around your eyes...<break time="3s"/>

Your jaw unclenches...<break time="2s"/>
your tongue rests softly in your mouth...<break time="2.5s"/>
your neck releases...<break time="3s"/>

The golden light flows into your shoulders...<break time="2s"/>
melting away tension...<break time="2s"/>
cascading down your arms...<break time="2s"/>
all the way to your fingertips...<break time="3.5s"/>

Your chest expands with ease...<break time="2s"/>
your heart beats steady and calm...<break time="2.5s"/>
your belly softens...<break time="3s"/>

The warmth continues down<break time="1s"/>
through your hips...<break time="1.5s"/>
your thighs...<break time="1.5s"/>
your knees...<break time="1.5s"/>
calves...<break time="1.5s"/>
ankles...<break time="1.5s"/>
and feet...<break time="3s"/>

You are held...<break time="2s"/>
you are supported...<break time="2s"/>
you are safe.<break time="4s"/>

And now I'm going to count down from ten to one...<break time="2.5s"/>
and with each number...<break time="1.5s"/>
you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to drift deeper...<break time="2s"/>
more relaxed...<break time="2s"/>
more open...<break time="3.5s"/>

Ten...<break time="2s"/>
drifting down...<break time="2.5s"/>
Nine...<break time="2s"/>
letting go...<break time="2.5s"/>
Eight...<break time="2s"/>
deeper still...<break time="2.5s"/>
Seven...<break time="2s"/>
so peaceful...<break time="2.5s"/>
Six...<break time="2s"/>
releasing...<break time="2.5s"/>
Five...<break time="2s"/>
halfway there...<break time="2.5s"/>
Four...<break time="2s"/>
sinking softly...<break time="2.5s"/>
Three...<break time="2s"/>
almost there...<break time="2.5s"/>
Two...<break time="2s"/>
so close...<break time="2.5s"/>
One...<break time="4s"/>

You have arrived.<break time="5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And here...<break time="2s"/>
in this deep place of stillness...<break time="2.5s"/>
you begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis><break time="1s"/>
a shimmering doorway of light<break time="1s"/>
appearing before you.<break time="3.5s"/>

It pulses with the colors of a thousand sunsets...<break time="2.5s"/>
rose gold...<break time="1.5s"/>
magenta...<break time="1.5s"/>
electric violet...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the softest blush pink.<break time="3.5s"/>

[SFX: Ethereal synth pad, rising shimmer, bright and warm, 5 seconds]

You step through the doorway...<break time="2.5s"/>
and find yourself standing<break time="1s"/>
on the edge of an extravagant cosmic stage...<break time="3.5s"/>

Above you...<break time="2s"/>
a cathedral of stars arches overhead...<break time="2.5s"/>
each one glittering with wild brilliance...<break time="3s"/>

Below you...<break time="2s"/>
the stage floor is made of mirrored glass...<break time="2s"/>
reflecting infinite versions of yourself...<break time="2.5s"/>
each one radiant...<break time="2s"/>
each one powerful...<break time="2s"/>
each one free.<break time="4s"/>

The air around you hums with music...<break time="2s"/>
a symphony of drums and strings and voices...<break time="2.5s"/>
a soundscape that feels both ancient<break time="1.5s"/>
and impossibly new.<break time="3.5s"/>

You can <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> the vibrations in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
a deep bass pulse that matches the rhythm of your heart.<break time="4s"/>

And as you stand here...<break time="2s"/>
breathing in the electric perfume of sequins and stage lights...<break time="3s"/>
a figure emerges from the wings.<break time="3.5s"/>

She is luminous...<break time="2s"/>
draped in a gown that seems woven from rose petals and stardust...<break time="3s"/>
her presence warm...<break time="2s"/>
nurturing...<break time="2s"/>
tender.<break time="3s"/>

This is the <emphasis level="moderate">Rose Mother</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
the archetype of unconditional love<break time="1.5s"/>
and radical acceptance.<break time="4s"/>

She smiles at you...<break time="2s"/>
and her eyes hold galaxies of compassion.<break time="3.5s"/>

She steps closer<break time="1.5s"/>
and places a single rose<break time="1s"/>
into your hands.<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Soft harp glissando, delicate and sweet, 3 seconds]

The rose is unlike any you've ever seen...<break time="2.5s"/>
its petals shift between gold and crimson and pearl...<break time="3s"/>
and as you hold it...<break time="2s"/>
you <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> a gentle warmth<break time="1s"/>
spreading from your palms<break time="1s"/>
into your heart.<break time="4s"/>

The Rose Mother whispers...<break time="2.5s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">You are loved exactly as you are.</emphasis><break time="3s"/>
Not for what you do...<break time="2s"/>
not for what you achieve...<break time="2s"/>
but simply because you exist.<break time="4.5s"/>

Breathe that in...<break time="3s"/>
let it settle into the deepest parts of you.<break time="4s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="2s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go.<break time="5s"/>

Now...<break time="2s"/>
from the opposite side of the stage...<break time="2.5s"/>
another presence steps into the light.<break time="3.5s"/>

This one moves with quiet purpose...<break time="2.5s"/>
dressed in robes of soft green and silver...<break time="3s"/>
carrying a staff crowned with a glowing emerald crystal.<break time="3.5s"/>

This is the <emphasis level="moderate">Inner Healer</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
the part of you that knows how to mend<break time="1.5s"/>
what has been broken...<break time="2s"/>
how to soothe what has been wounded...<break time="2.5s"/>
how to restore what has been lost.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer approaches<break time="1.5s"/>
and touches the staff to your chest...<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Low resonant singing bowl, warm tone, 4 seconds with gentle decay]

And you feel a wave of cool...<break time="2s"/>
soothing energy<break time="1s"/>
washing through your body...<break time="3s"/>

Old pain begins to <emphasis level="moderate">dissolve</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
old shame begins to <emphasis level="moderate">lift</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
old fear begins to <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis>...<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer speaks in a voice like flowing water:<break time="3s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">You have always carried the power to heal yourself.</emphasis><break time="3.5s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">Trust the wisdom of your own becoming.</emphasis><break time="5s"/>

And now...<break time="2.5s"/>
the lights on the stage shift...<break time="2.5s"/>
growing brighter...<break time="2s"/>
warmer...<break time="2s"/>
more radiant.<break time="3.5s"/>

A third figure steps forward from the center spotlight...<break time="3s"/>
and this one blazes with golden fire.<break time="3.5s"/>

Draped in flames that do not burn...<break time="2.5s"/>
crowned with a halo of living light...<break time="2.5s"/>
this is the <emphasis level="moderate">Heart Flame Tender</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>
the keeper of your passion...<break time="2s"/>
your courage...<break time="2s"/>
your wild...<break time="1.5s"/>
uncontainable...<break time="1.5s"/>
creative fire.<break time="4.5s"/>

The Heart Flame Tender extends a hand to you...<break time="2.5s"/>
and in their palm burns a small golden flame.<break time="3.5s"/>

[SFX: Crackling fire ambience, gentle and warm, 5 seconds]

<emphasis level="moderate">This is yours</emphasis>, they say.<break time="2.5s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">It has always been yours.</emphasis><break time="3s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">The flame that lights the stage of your life.</emphasis><break time="4s"/>

You reach out<break time="1.5s"/>
and take the flame into your own hands...<break time="3s"/>

And as you hold it...<break time="2s"/>
you <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> it merge with your heart...<break time="3s"/>
igniting a brilliance within you<break time="1.5s"/>
that has been waiting...<break time="2s"/>
waiting to be seen...<break time="2s"/>
waiting to be expressed...<break time="2.5s"/>
waiting to shine without apology.<break time="5s"/>

The three archetypes stand around you now...<break time="2.5s"/>
the Rose Mother...<break time="1.5s"/>
the Inner Healer...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the Heart Flame Tender...<break time="3s"/>

And together they sing a wordless harmony<break time="1.5s"/>
that vibrates through your entire being...<break time="4s"/>

You <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> yourself expanding...<break time="2.5s"/>
growing brighter...<break time="2s"/>
more fully yourself than you have ever been.<break time="4.5s"/>

The stage beneath you begins to glow...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you realize<break time="1.5s"/>
that this extravagant show...<break time="2s"/>
this cosmic theater of transformation...<break time="2.5s"/>
has always been yours to command.<break time="4s"/>

You are the star.<break time="2.5s"/>
You are the director.<break time="2.5s"/>
You are the composer of your own symphony.<break time="5s"/>

And in this moment...<break time="2s"/>
you <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to step fully into that light.<break time="4s"/>

You <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to be seen.<break time="3s"/>
You <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to be bold.<break time="3s"/>
You <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> to be extravagantly...<break time="2s"/>
unapologetically...<break time="2s"/>
magnificently<break time="1s"/>
you.<break time="6s"/>
