<!-- AWAKENING (3 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Good morning. <break time="2s"/>

Take a moment to appreciate this... you've woken to a new day. <break time="2s"/>
A day that has never existed before. <break time="2s"/>
Full of possibility. <break time="3s"/>

Before you open your eyes fully... before you check your phone or think about your schedule... give yourself these few minutes. <break time="2s"/>

This is your time to set the tone for everything that follows. <break time="3s"/>

Take a deep breath in... <break time="3s"/>
And let it out slowly... welcoming the day. <break time="4s"/>

Another breath... feeling your body wake up. <break time="3s"/>
Oxygen flowing. <break time="2s"/>
Energy beginning to circulate. <break time="4s"/>

Stretch if you'd like. <break time="2s"/>
Gently... luxuriously. <break time="2s"/>
Let your body know it's time to move. <break time="4s"/>

Good. <break time="2s"/>
You're here. <break time="2s"/>
The day begins.

<!-- ACTIVATION (6 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Now... let's activate joy. <break time="2s"/>

Joy isn't something that happens to you... it's something you cultivate. <break time="2s"/>
And right now... in this quiet morning moment... is the perfect time to cultivate it. <break time="3s"/>

Think of three things you're grateful for. <break time="3s"/>
They can be small... your warm bed... the air in your lungs... someone who loves you. <break time="3s"/>
Or they can be large... your health... your home... the opportunities ahead. <break time="4s"/>

Name them now... in your mind. <break time="4s"/>

One. <break time="3s"/>
Two. <break time="3s"/>
Three. <break time="4s"/>

Feel the warmth of gratitude in your chest. <break time="2s"/>
This is the foundation of joy. <break time="3s"/>

Now... imagine that warmth growing. <break time="2s"/>
Expanding outward from your heart. <break time="2s"/>
Filling your entire chest. <break time="3s"/>

Let it spread into your arms... down to your fingertips. <break time="3s"/>
Into your belly... warm and content. <break time="3s"/>
Down through your legs... to your toes. <break time="3s"/>
Up into your neck... your face... the crown of your head. <break time="4s"/>

Your entire body is now glowing with this warm, joyful energy. <break time="4s"/>

Smile. <break time="2s"/>
Right now... let a genuine smile spread across your face. <break time="3s"/>

Research shows that smiling... even if you start before you feel happy... actually changes your brain chemistry. <break time="3s"/>
It releases dopamine and serotonin. <break time="2s"/>
It tells your brain... this is a good day. <break time="4s"/>

Keep smiling as we continue. <break time="3s"/>

Say to yourself... either aloud or in your mind... <break time="2s"/>

Today is going to be a great day. <break time="3s"/>

I have everything I need within me. <break time="3s"/>

Good things are coming my way. <break time="3s"/>

I choose joy. <break time="4s"/>

Feel the truth of these words. <break time="2s"/>
They're not wishful thinking... they're declarations. <break time="2s"/>
You're setting the frequency for your day. <break time="4s"/>
</prosody>
<break time="4s"/>

<!-- INTENTION SETTING (4 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Now... let's set your intention for today. <break time="3s"/>

Think about what's ahead. <break time="2s"/>
The tasks, conversations, and challenges waiting for you. <break time="3s"/>

Ask yourself... <break time="2s"/>
What quality do I want to embody today? <break time="4s"/>

Perhaps it's patience. <break time="2s"/>
Perhaps it's courage. <break time="2s"/>
Perhaps it's kindness. <break time="2s"/>
Perhaps it's focus. <break time="2s"/>
Perhaps it's playfulness. <break time="4s"/>

Choose one quality. <break time="3s"/>
Hold it in your mind. <break time="3s"/>

Say to yourself... <break time="2s"/>
Today, I embody... <break time="3s"/>
And name your quality. <break time="4s"/>

This intention is like a compass. <break time="2s"/>
Throughout the day... when you face decisions or challenges... you can ask... <break time="2s"/>
What would my chosen quality look like right now? <break time="4s"/>

Now... visualize one moment from your day going exactly as you'd like. <break time="4s"/>

Perhaps it's a meeting that flows smoothly. <break time="2s"/>
Perhaps it's a workout that feels strong. <break time="2s"/>
Perhaps it's a conversation that goes well. <break time="3s"/>

See it in your mind. <break time="3s"/>
See yourself succeeding. <break time="3s"/>
Feel the satisfaction of it. <break time="4s"/>

This visualization primes your brain for success. <break time="3s"/>
You're rehearsing your best day before it happens.

<break time="4s"/>

<!-- CLOSING (2 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Take one final deep breath. <break time="3s"/>

You are ready. <break time="2s"/>

You're filled with gratitude... joy... and clear intention. <break time="3s"/>

As you move into your day... carry this energy with you. <break time="2s"/>
Let it influence your thoughts, your words, your actions. <break time="3s"/>

And remember... you can always return to this feeling. <break time="2s"/>
A few deep breaths. <break time="2s"/>
A smile. <break time="2s"/>
A moment of gratitude. <break time="3s"/>

Joy is always available. <break time="3s"/>

Now... open your eyes if they're still closed. <break time="3s"/>

Stand up. <break time="2s"/>
Stretch tall. <break time="3s"/>

You've got this. <break time="2s"/>

Go create an amazing day. <break time="3s"/>
