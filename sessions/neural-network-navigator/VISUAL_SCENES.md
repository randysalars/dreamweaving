## IMAGE GENERATION WORKFLOW

### Manual external generation

1. Open `IMAGE_PROMPTS_FOR_EXTERNAL_GENERATION.md` for the exact prompts, negative prompts, and filenames.
2. Generate all 8 images at 1920x1080 with your preferred AI image service (Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.).
3. Keep palette/lighting consistent across the arc (scene 06 should be the brightest gamma burst).
4. Save outputs to `sessions/neural-network-navigator/images/` using the exact `*_FINAL.png` names listed in the prompt file.

### After generating
- Confirm filenames match the convention below.
- If artifacts or style drift appear, adjust the negative prompt in the manual prompt file and regenerate externally.

   - Volumetric effects (god rays, soft fog)
   - Progressive brightening: dim → bright (gamma) → steady → soft

4. **Composition**:
   - Landscape orientation (1920x1080)
   - Adequate depth of field
   - Not cluttered - space for eye to rest
   - Progressive journey: close → descend → panorama → dynamic → unified → burst → stable → ascending

5. **Emotional Arc** (visual storytelling):
   - Opening: Inviting, mysterious
   - Descent: Trusting, releasing
   - Garden: Wonder, recognition
   - Pathfinder: Discovery, playful
   - Weaver: Profound, sacred

## PROMPT ENGINEERING TIPS

For best results with SDXL:

1. **Start with main subject**: "A mesmerizing view of..." or "A breathtaking panorama of..."
2. **Add key details**: Specific elements that must be present
3. **Lighting and atmosphere**: How it should feel
4. **Technical quality**: "photorealistic, extremely detailed, 8K quality"
5. **Emotional tone**: Final descriptor of feeling
6. **Keep negative prompts strong**: Exclude unwanted elements firmly

If first generation doesn't match vision:
- Adjust guidance_scale (7.0-8.5 range)
- Try different seeds
- Refine prompt with more specific descriptors
- Add problematic elements to negative prompt

---

## QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each image:

- [ ] Matches the intended emotional tone
- [ ] Color palette consistent with session arc
- [ ] Bioluminescent neural elements clearly visible
- [ ] Not too dark or too bright (except gamma burst)
- [ ] No unwanted elements (faces, text, mechanical circuits)
- [ ] Composition works in 16:9 landscape format
- [ ] High enough quality for 1080p video
- [ ] Feels cohesive with other scenes in session

---

## ALTERNATIVE: AI Art Platforms

If not using local SDXL, these platforms also work (but with usage costs):

1. **Midjourney** (Discord bot): Excellent quality, use `/imagine` command with prompts above
2. **DALL-E 3** (OpenAI): Good for photorealistic, may need prompt adaptation
3. **Leonardo.AI**: Free tier available, SDXL models
4. **DreamStudio** (Stability AI): Official Stable Diffusion interface

Note: Local SDXL generation is recommended for unlimited iterations and full control.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

**Critical Synchronization Points**:
- Scene 6 (Gamma Burst) must appear EXACTLY at 18:45 (1125 seconds)
- This 3-second image syncs with 40 Hz binaural burst and sound effect flash
- Test synchronization thoroughly before final export

**Visual Effects**:
- Consider adding subtle particle effects or light rays in post
- Gentle zoom/pan (Ken Burns) can add life to still images
- Avoid rapid or jarring movements - keep meditative pace

**Aspect Ratio**:
- 16:9 landscape is standard for YouTube/streaming
- If creating vertical format (9:16 for mobile), regenerate at 1080x1920
