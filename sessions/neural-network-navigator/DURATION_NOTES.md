## Duration Discrepancy Resolution

### Actual Current Duration
- **Mastered Audio File**: `neural_network_navigator_v2_MASTERED.mp3`
- **Actual Duration**: 28:43 (1723 seconds)

### Historical Durations Documented

Different versions and components have different durations:

1. **V1 (Original)**: 23:41 (1421 seconds)
   - Referenced in: `PRODUCTION_WORKFLOW.md`, `create_ultimate_audio.sh`
   - This was the original voice-only duration

2. **V2 (Extended)**: 28:00 (1680 seconds)
   - Referenced in: `MEDITATION_SCRIPT.md`, `composite_final_video_optimized.py`
   - This was the target duration for the extended V2 script

3. **V2 Final (Mastered)**: 28:43 (1723 seconds)
   - The actual final mastered audio with all enhancements
   - Includes pink noise fade-in/out, binaural beats, mastering processing

### Explanation

The duration differences are due to:
- **V1 → V2**: Complete script rewrite with extended content
- **V2 Target → V2 Final**: Additional processing (fade-ins, fade-outs, mastering tail)

### Current Standard

**Use 28:43 (1723 seconds)** as the canonical duration for Neural Network Navigator V2.

### Files to Update

If updating documentation, use these guidelines:
- `PRODUCTION_WORKFLOW.md`: Update to reflect V2 duration (28:43)
- `PRODUCTION_MANUAL_V2.md`: Already correct, references 28+ min
- Historical V1 references: Leave as-is for historical accuracy
- New documentation: Use 28:43 (1723 seconds)

**Note**: This is normal evolution of a session. Duration may vary slightly based on:
- TTS voice selection
- Speaking rate adjustments
- Mastering processing tail
- Fade-in/fade-out lengths
