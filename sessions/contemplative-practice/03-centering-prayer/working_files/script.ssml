Welcome to Centering Prayer. <break time="1.5s"/>

Centering prayer is a method of silent prayer that prepares us to receive the gift of God's presence. <break time="2s"/>

Developed by Father Thomas Keating and other Trappist monks... it draws from the wisdom of the Desert Fathers and the author of The Cloud of Unknowing. <break time="2s"/>

The practice is simple. <break time="1.5s"/>
You choose a sacred word as a symbol of your intention to consent to God's presence and action within. <break time="2s"/>

When you become aware of thoughts... you gently return to the sacred word. <break time="2s"/>

That's it. <break time="1.5s"/>
Simple... but profound. <break time="2s"/>

Close your eyes. <break time="1.5s"/>
Let's begin.

<break time="3s"/>

<!-- PREPARATION (3 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Take a moment to settle into stillness. <break time="3s"/>

A few deep breaths... <break time="3s"/>
Letting your body relax completely. <break time="4s"/>

Now... choose your sacred word. <break time="3s"/>

This word is not meant for meditation or reflection... it's simply a symbol of your intention to consent to God's presence. <break time="3s"/>

Some common sacred words are... <break time="2s"/>
Jesus. <break time="2s"/>
Abba. <break time="2s"/>
Love. <break time="2s"/>
Peace. <break time="2s"/>
Mercy. <break time="2s"/>
Yes. <break time="3s"/>

Let a word arise that feels right for you today. <break time="4s"/>

Once chosen... stay with this word throughout the prayer period. <break time="4s"/>

Your sacred word is ready. <break time="3s"/>

Now... silently introduce it as a symbol of your consent to God's presence and action within.

<!-- CENTERING PRAYER PERIOD (12 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
The prayer period begins now. <break time="4s"/>

Rest in God's presence. <break time="3s"/>
Let go of all thoughts. <break time="4s"/>

When you become aware of thoughts... feelings... images... or sensations... gently return to your sacred word. <break time="4s"/>

Very gently. <break time="3s"/>
Not with force or effort. <break time="2s"/>
Just the slightest turning back to the sacred word. <break time="5s"/>

Rest now in the silence. <break time="8s"/>

If thoughts arise... and they will... simply return gently to the sacred word. <break time="5s"/>

Rest. <break time="10s"/>

The sacred word is just a symbol. <break time="3s"/>
A way of saying yes to God. <break time="3s"/>
Let it be like a feather touching a soap bubble... that light. <break time="6s"/>

Continue to rest. <break time="8s"/>

Thoughts are normal. <break time="2s"/>
They're not the enemy. <break time="2s"/>
Simply return to your intention... symbolized by the sacred word. <break time="6s"/>

Rest in the presence. <break time="10s"/>

Let go. <break time="5s"/>

Let God. <break time="8s"/>

If you've been caught in thoughts... that's perfectly natural. <break time="3s"/>
Gently return to the sacred word. <break time="5s"/>

No judgment. <break time="2s"/>
Just returning. <break time="8s"/>

Continue to rest. <break time="6s"/>

The fruits of this prayer often appear in daily life... not during the prayer itself. <break time="4s"/>

Trust the process. <break time="3s"/>
Trust the silence. <break time="3s"/>
Trust the God who dwells within you. <break time="8s"/>

Rest. <break time="10s"/>

The prayer period is gently coming to an end. <break time="4s"/>

But remain in silence for a few more moments. <break time="5s"/>
</prosody>
<break time="5s"/>

<!-- CLOSING (3 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Let go of the sacred word now. <break time="3s"/>

Remain in interior silence for two minutes... allowing the prayer to transition gently back to ordinary awareness. <break time="4s"/>

This transitional time is important. <break time="3s"/>
It allows the fruits of deep prayer to be brought into daily life. <break time="5s"/>

Rest in the silence. <break time="15s"/>
</prosody>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
Now... gently bring your awareness back to your body. <break time="3s"/>

Feel the surface beneath you. <break time="2s"/>
The air around you. <break time="3s"/>

You might pray the Lord's Prayer silently... or another prayer that feels meaningful. <break time="5s"/>

When you're ready... let your eyes open gently. <break time="3s"/>

May the silence you've touched remain with you. <break time="3s"/>

May God's presence continue to work in you throughout this day. <break time="3s"/>

Amen.
