notes: |
  This pack draws from Christian contemplative traditions:
  - Desert Fathers and Mothers
  - Carmelite spirituality (John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila)
  - Centering Prayer movement (Thomas Keating)
  - Ignatian spirituality

  Language is explicitly Christian but accessible to all seekers.
  Emphasis on surrender, receptivity, and divine encounter.
