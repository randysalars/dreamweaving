The surface reflects green and gold, and you dip your fingers in the water, feeling coolness and clarity.<break time=\"3s\"/> You may imagine sipping a small mouthful—clean, crisp, and sweet—washing away what no longer serves.<break time=\"3s\"/> Your mind naturally begins to <emphasis level=\"moderate\">release</emphasis> old tension...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and your body remembers how to feel light and steady.<break time=\"3s\"/></prosody>\n\n[SFX: Gentle water ripple with soft chime, 3s decay]\n\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">The Inner Healer appears as a quiet, luminous presence in your imagination, not as a literal being, but as a symbol of your God-given capacity for healing and renewal.<break time=\"4s\"/> It stands like a mirror of your own strength, reflecting your resilience and care.<break time=\"3s\"/> You can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">notice</emphasis> that healing has always been part of you...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">allow</emphasis> it to grow brighter now.<break time=\"3s\"/></prosody>\n\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">And the deeper you go...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> the more natural it feels...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> the deeper you <emphasis level=\"moderate\">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time=\"4s\"/> You can choose to go <emphasis level=\"strong\">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time=\"2s\"/> or you can wait...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time=\"1.5s\"/> simply by listening.<break time=\"4s\"/></prosody>\n\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">A soft rain begins, gentle and warm, and each drop feels like a blessing of calm. You can feel the coolness on your skin, hear it patter on leaves, and smell the rich earth that rises as the forest breathes with you.<break time=\"4s\"/> You can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">trust</emphasis> this rhythm...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and <emphasis level=\"moderate\">relax</emphasis> into it.<break time=\"3s\"/></prosody>\n\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">In a clearing, a stone with carved spiral patterns rests beside a small fire. You notice a golden amulet lying there, warm to the touch. This is a symbolic gift—a reminder of your centered heart, not a source of power over you, but a mirror of Christ's protection and your own discernment.<break time=\"4s\"/> You decide, in your own way, to accept it or simply notice it...<break time=\"3s\"/> and either way, the message is received.<break time=\"3s\"/></prosody>\n\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">You may hear a low, comforting hum in the jungle, like a distant drum or a steady pulse.

The jungle opens into a garden of renewal with towering palms and flowering trees. Butterflies move through beams of sunlight, and their colors shift like stained glass.<break time=\"4s\"/> You feel a light breeze, soft and cool, across your face, and you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">allow</emphasis> gratitude to rise naturally.<break time=\"3s\"/></prosody>\n\n[SFX: Bright jungle chorus swell, 5s fade]\n\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">Here, the Rose Mother symbolizes your capacity to nurture yourself with patience and kindness. You notice her as a presence of gentle care within your own heart, not outside of you, but within you.<break time=\"4s\"/> She offers a simple message: you are safe to heal...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> safe to grow...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> safe to be loved.<break time=\"3s\"/> You can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">accept</emphasis> that truth now...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> as a soft warmth flows through your chest and belly.<break time=\"3s\"/></prosody>\n\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">The Heart Flame Tender stands beside a small, steady flame, and you see how it remains bright without effort. It invites you to keep your own inner flame steady through simple practices: breathing, listening, and choosing what is right for you.<break time=\"4s\"/> You can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">choose</emphasis> that steadiness...<break time=\"2.5s\"/> and <emphasis level=\"moderate\">trust</emphasis> your ability to return to it whenever you need.<break time=\"3s\"/></prosody>\n\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">You notice a pathway of light leading to a small overlook where you can see the jungle canopy stretching into the distance.
