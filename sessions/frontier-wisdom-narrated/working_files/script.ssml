<!-- INTRODUCTION (3 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
There's a fire crackling before us... and the stars are coming out one by one across the endless Western sky. <break time="2s"/>

This is the kind of night when stories get told. <break time="2s"/>

Not just any stories... but the ones that carry wisdom. <break time="2s"/>
The ones that traveled from campfire to campfire across the frontier... passed from old hands to young ones... because they held something true. <break time="3s"/>

The men and women who settled the West faced hardships we can barely imagine. <break time="2s"/>
And yet... they didn't just survive. <break time="2s"/>
Many of them found a kind of wisdom out there... in the vast silence of the plains... in the unforgiving honesty of the land. <break time="3s"/>

Tonight... I want to share four stories with you. <break time="2s"/>
Each one carries a different piece of that frontier wisdom. <break time="2s"/>
Lessons that are just as true today as they were a hundred fifty years ago. <break time="3s"/>

So settle in. <break time="2s"/>
Let the fire warm you. <break time="2s"/>
And listen. <break time="4s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- STORY 1: THE CATTLEMAN'S PATIENCE (7 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The first story is about a man named Josiah Kellerman. <break time="2s"/>

Josiah came west from Pennsylvania in eighteen sixty-eight... looking to make his fortune in cattle. <break time="2s"/>
He had a little money... a lot of ambition... and almost no idea what he was getting into. <break time="3s"/>

His first year... he lost half his herd to a hard winter. <break time="2s"/>
His second year... a prairie fire took his cabin and most of what he owned. <break time="2s"/>
His third year... rustlers made off with a hundred head. <break time="3s"/>

Any reasonable man would have gone back East. <break time="2s"/>
Josiah stayed. <break time="3s"/>

But here's what changed. <break time="2s"/>

After the fire... when he was sitting in the ashes of what had been his home... an old Cheyenne man rode up. <break time="2s"/>
The man didn't speak much English... and Josiah didn't speak any Cheyenne. <break time="2s"/>
But somehow... they communicated. <break time="3s"/>

The old man pointed to a tree nearby... a cottonwood that had somehow survived the fire. <break time="2s"/>
It was blackened... many of its branches were dead. <break time="2s"/>
But at its core... green shoots were already emerging. <break time="3s"/>

The old man said one word in broken English. <break time="2s"/>
"Wait." <break time="3s"/>

Josiah didn't understand at first. <break time="2s"/>
But in the weeks that followed... as he rebuilt... he watched that tree. <break time="2s"/>
Within a year... it was fuller than it had been before the fire. <break time="2s"/>
The burning had cleared away the dead weight... and something stronger had grown in its place. <break time="3s"/>

Josiah learned the lesson. <break time="2s"/>

After that... when trouble came... and trouble always came on the frontier... Josiah didn't rage against it. <break time="2s"/>
He didn't despair. <break time="2s"/>
He waited. <break time="2s"/>
He did what needed to be done... and he trusted that like that cottonwood... something stronger would emerge. <break time="3s"/>

By the time he died... at the age of eighty-four... Josiah Kellerman owned one of the largest ranches in Wyoming. <break time="2s"/>
His sons asked him once what his secret was. <break time="3s"/>

He said... "I learned to wait longer than my troubles lasted." <break time="3s"/>

Patience. <break time="2s"/>
The frontier taught patience. <break time="2s"/>
Not passive waiting... but active patience. <break time="2s"/>
Keep working. <break time="2s"/>
Keep building. <break time="2s"/>
And trust that the storm will pass. <break time="5s"/>

<!-- STORY 2: THE PIONEER WOMAN'S STRENGTH (7 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The second story is about a woman named Martha Crane. <break time="2s"/>

Martha came west on the Oregon Trail in eighteen forty-seven with her husband Thomas and their three children. <break time="2s"/>
Thomas was a farmer... a good man... steady and hardworking. <break time="3s"/>

They were crossing the Rockies when the wagon train was hit by cholera. <break time="2s"/>
Thomas was one of the first to fall sick. <break time="2s"/>
He died within two days. <break time="3s"/>

Martha was thirty-one years old... alone in the mountains... with three children under ten and winter coming on fast. <break time="3s"/>

The wagon master offered to turn back. <break time="2s"/>
Others suggested she wait out the winter at Fort Laramie and return East in spring. <break time="3s"/>

Martha considered it. <break time="2s"/>
She grieved for Thomas. <break time="2s"/>
She was afraid. <break time="3s"/>

But in her quiet moments... she remembered something her grandmother had told her as a girl. <break time="2s"/>
"You have more in you than you know. But you'll never find out what it is until you need it." <break time="4s"/>

Martha decided to press on. <break time="3s"/>

She drove the wagon herself. <break time="2s"/>
She hunted when the men couldn't spare time to help. <break time="2s"/>
She navigated river crossings that would make a grown man pale. <break time="3s"/>

When they reached Oregon... Martha claimed land in Thomas's name. <break time="2s"/>
She built a cabin with her own hands... her children carrying logs that were almost too heavy for them. <break time="3s"/>

For fifty years... Martha worked that land. <break time="2s"/>
She raised her three children... and then helped raise their children too. <break time="2s"/>
She became known throughout the territory as a woman you could count on... whether you needed a midwife at midnight or a sharp word of truth no one else would speak. <break time="4s"/>

Late in her life... someone asked Martha how she'd found the strength to continue after Thomas died. <break time="3s"/>

She smiled... that weathered face creased with years of sun and wind. <break time="2s"/>
"Strength isn't something you have," she said. <break time="2s"/>
"It's something you find when you have no choice but to look for it." <break time="4s"/>

The frontier taught that too. <break time="2s"/>
Strength isn't the absence of fear. <break time="2s"/>
It's what you find on the other side of fear... when you keep going anyway. <break time="5s"/>

<!-- STORY 3: THE LAWMAN'S CODE (7 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The third story is about a man named Jack Harlow. <break time="2s"/>

Jack was a deputy in a small town in New Mexico Territory... back when the line between lawman and outlaw was often thin as a knife edge. <break time="3s"/>

One autumn... a gang rode into town. <break time="2s"/>
The Reyes brothers... four of them... and their cousin Miguel. <break time="2s"/>
They'd been terrorizing settlements up and down the territory for two years. <break time="2s"/>
Robbery, murder... folks lived in fear of their name. <break time="3s"/>

The sheriff was out of town. <break time="2s"/>
Jack was all there was. <break time="3s"/>

The Reyes brothers knew it. <break time="2s"/>
They strutted into the saloon like they owned the place. <break time="2s"/>
Which... for all practical purposes... they did. <break time="2s"/>
Who was going to stop them? <break time="2s"/>
One deputy against five killers? <break time="3s"/>

What happened next became legend. <break time="3s"/>

Jack didn't ride out to confront them. <break time="2s"/>
He didn't gather a posse... there wasn't time. <break time="2s"/>
He walked into that saloon alone. <break time="3s"/>

But before he went... he wrote a note. <break time="2s"/>
Just a few lines. <break time="2s"/>
He left it with the livery stable owner. <break time="3s"/>

The note said: "A man is measured by what he does when no one's watching and there's no reward for doing right. Today I do my duty. That's enough." <break time="4s"/>

Jack walked into that saloon knowing he probably wouldn't walk out. <break time="3s"/>

He didn't draw first. <break time="2s"/>
He gave them a chance to surrender. <break time="2s"/>
They laughed at him. <break time="2s"/>
And then... as the story goes... the youngest Reyes went for his gun. <break time="3s"/>

When the smoke cleared... three of the five were dead. <break time="2s"/>
Jack was wounded... but standing. <break time="2s"/>
The two survivors surrendered. <break time="3s"/>

Jack Harlow served as sheriff of that town for another thirty years. <break time="2s"/>
He never talked about that day... not once. <break time="2s"/>
But the note he wrote... that was passed down. <break time="2s"/>
His descendants still have it. <break time="3s"/>

The lesson Jack lived by... the lesson the frontier carved into men who stood for something... was simple. <break time="3s"/>

Do what's right. <break time="2s"/>
Not because someone's watching. <break time="2s"/>
Not because you'll be rewarded. <break time="2s"/>
But because that's who you are. <break time="3s"/>

That's enough. <break time="5s"/>

<!-- STORY 4: THE WANDERER'S PEACE (4 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
The last story is the shortest. <break time="2s"/>
And in some ways... the most important. <break time="3s"/>

There was an old man... name lost to history... who wandered the frontier in the eighteen eighties. <break time="2s"/>
No one knew where he came from. <break time="2s"/>
He had no ranch... no family that anyone knew of... no obvious purpose. <break time="2s"/>
Just a mule, a bedroll, and an old Bible. <break time="3s"/>

He'd appear at farms and ranches... trade a day's work for a meal and a place by the fire. <break time="2s"/>
He never asked for money. <break time="2s"/>
He never complained. <break time="3s"/>

And there was something about him... a stillness... that made people want to be near him. <break time="3s"/>

A young cowhand asked him once... "Old man, what are you looking for out here? What do you want?" <break time="3s"/>

The old man looked up at the sky... that big Western sky that seems to go on forever. <break time="2s"/>
He smiled. <break time="2s"/>
"I've already found it," he said. <break time="2s"/>
"I stopped wanting." <break time="4s"/>

He wasn't talking about giving up on life. <break time="2s"/>
He still worked. <break time="2s"/>
He still traveled. <break time="2s"/>
He still engaged with people. <break time="3s"/>

But somewhere along the way... he'd made peace with what is. <break time="2s"/>
He'd stopped fighting against life... and started flowing with it. <break time="3s"/>

That's the last piece of frontier wisdom. <break time="2s"/>
After all the patience... after all the strength... after all the integrity... there's peace. <break time="3s"/>

The peace of a person who's made their peace with the land... with themselves... with life as it is. <break time="5s"/>

<!-- CLOSING (2 minutes) -->

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
The fire's burning low now. <break time="2s"/>
Stars have filled the sky from horizon to horizon. <break time="3s"/>

Four stories. <break time="2s"/>
Four pieces of wisdom. <break time="3s"/>

Patience... to wait longer than your troubles last. <break time="3s"/>
Strength... found only when you have no choice but to find it. <break time="3s"/>
Integrity... doing what's right because that's who you are. <break time="3s"/>
And peace... made with life as it is. <break time="4s"/>

The frontier is gone now... settled, tamed, turned into something else. <break time="2s"/>
But these truths haven't changed. <break time="2s"/>
They're just as real in a city as they were on the open range. <break time="3s"/>

Carry them with you. <break time="2s"/>

And when life gets hard... when the storms come... remember those who came before. <break time="3s"/>
Remember what they learned under these same stars. <break time="3s"/>

And ride on. <break time="4s"/>
