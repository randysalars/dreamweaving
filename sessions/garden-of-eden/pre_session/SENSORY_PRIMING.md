## Purpose
Create an optimal multisensory environment to enhance trance susceptibility, deepen immersion, and prime the nervous system for altered states.

## 🌿 Aromatherapy Protocol

### Recommended Essential Oils
Use **ONE** of the following, not multiple:

1. **Lavender** (Lavandula angustifolia)
   - Effect: Calming, parasympathetic activation
   - Best for: Anxiety reduction, sleep preparation
   - Application: 2-3 drops in diffuser, 30 min before session

2. **Sandalwood** (Santalum album)
   - Effect: Grounding, meditative, sacred space
   - Best for: Spiritual connection, root chakra activation
   - Application: 2-3 drops in diffuser or apply diluted to wrists

3. **Frankincense** (Boswellia carterii)
   - Effect: Deepens breath, crown chakra activation
   - Best for: Mystical experiences, divine connection
   - Application: 1-2 drops in diffuser (potent)

4. **Jasmine** (Jasminum officinale)
   - Effect: Heart-opening, sensual, euphoric
   - Best for: Emotional release, innocence work
   - Application: 1-2 drops diffused or as perfume

### Application Guidelines
- Start diffusing **30 minutes before** session
- Keep scent **subtle** (not overpowering)
- If using topical: dilute in carrier oil (coconut, jojoba)
- Avoid if pregnant or sensitive to fragrances
- Option: Natural incense (sandalwood, nag champa)

## 💡 Light & Color Protocol

### Pre-Session Lighting (15-30 min before)
- **Color**: Violet or deep indigo
- **Brightness**: Dim, indirect (like candles)
- **Purpose**: Activate pineal gland, prepare for visionary states
- **Options**:
  - LED color-changing bulbs
  - Himalayan salt lamp (orange/pink)
  - Violet LED strip lights
  - Candles (flame flicker aids hypnagogia)

### During Session Lighting
Choose ONE approach:

1. **Complete Darkness** (Recommended)
   - Use eye mask or blackout curtains
   - Enhances internal visuals
   - Maximizes theta wave production

2. **Ganzfeld Effect** (Advanced)
   - Soft, diffuse white or red light
   - No patterns, no shadows
   - Creates sensory deprivation
   - DIY: cut ping-pong balls in half, place over eyes with soft lamp

3. **Pulsing Light** (Optional, Advanced)
   - Programmable LEDs at 6-8 Hz (theta frequency)
   - Through closed eyelids
   - Entrains visual cortex
   - **Warning**: Not for epilepsy

### Post-Session Lighting
- Gradual brightening
- Start with warm orange/yellow
- Slow transition to normal light over 5-10 min
- Avoid harsh fluorescent immediately

## 🌡️ Temperature Optimization

### Ideal Temperature Range
- **68-72°F (20-22°C)**
- Slightly cool is better than warm
- Prevents drowsiness, enhances alertness in trance

### Why Temperature Matters
- Cooler temps → increased norepinephrine → enhanced focus
- Too warm → sleepiness, less vivid experience
- Too cold → distracting, muscle tension

### Setup
- Adjust thermostat 30 min before
- Have blanket available for comfort
- Feet tend to get cold: wear socks if needed
- Face should be slightly cool

---

## 🛏️ Physical Environment Setup

### Surface
- **Lying down**: Best for deep trance, full relaxation
  - Yoga mat + cushions
  - Bed (if you won't fall asleep)
  - Massage table
  - Zero-gravity chair
- **Seated**: If lying down triggers sleep
  - Meditation cushion
  - Reclined chair (not upright)
  - Wall support for spine

### Positioning
- Spine neutral and supported
- No crossing of arms/legs (blocks energy flow)
- Palms up or on heart (receptive position)
- Slight chin tuck (activates vagus nerve)
- Hips slightly elevated (lumbar support)

### Sound Isolation
- **Critical**: Use over-ear, closed-back headphones
- Noise-cancelling if available
- White noise machine if needed to mask external sounds
- Inform household: "Do Not Disturb" for 1 hour

## 🧘 Pre-Session Physical Preparation

### 1-2 Hours Before
- ✓ Light meal (not heavy, not empty)
- ✓ Hydrate well
- ✓ Avoid caffeine
- ✓ Avoid alcohol/substances
- ✓ Empty bladder right before

### 30 Minutes Before
- ✓ Start aromatherapy diffuser
- ✓ Adjust temperature
- ✓ Set up lighting
- ✓ Silence phone (airplane mode)
- ✓ Inform others not to disturb

### 10 Minutes Before
- ✓ Remove restrictive clothing
- ✓ Remove glasses/jewelry/watch
- ✓ Final bathroom break
- ✓ Take position

## 🎨 Optional: Visual Priming

### Sacred Space Creation
- Place meaningful objects in view:
  - Crystals (amethyst for third eye, rose quartz for heart)
  - Plants (living energy)
  - Sacred geometry art
  - Mandalas or yantras
- Arrange in a way that feels harmonious

### Color Meditation (5 min before)
- Gaze softly at a colored surface:
  - **Violet**: Crown chakra activation
  - **Indigo**: Third eye opening
  - **Green**: Heart centering
- Allow afterimages to form when you close eyes
- These color impressions seed visual hypnagogia
