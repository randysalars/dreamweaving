## Production Recommendations

### **Layering Structure (from bottom to top):**

1. **Base Layer:** Theta binaural beat (specific Hz for each section)
2. **Carrier Layer:** Solfeggio frequency (as outlined above)
3. **Ambient Layer:** Very subtle nature sounds (optional, <15% volume)
4. **Voice Layer:** The hypnotic script (primary, 100% reference)

### **Volume Mixing Guidelines:**

- **Voice:** 100% (reference level, -3dB peak)
- **Binaural/Carrier:** 25-35% of voice volume
- **Nature sounds:** 10-15% of voice volume (if used)
- **Critical:** Voice must ALWAYS be clearly dominant

### **Technical Specifications:**

- **Sample Rate:** 48kHz minimum (44.1kHz acceptable)
- **Bit Depth:** 24-bit for production, 16-bit for final export
- **Format:** WAV for production, MP3 320kbps or AAC for distribution
- **Pan:** Binaural beats require stereo; nature can be slightly panned for depth
- **EQ:** High-pass filter at 40Hz to remove subsonic rumble
