# Post-Session Integration Journal Protocol

## 📊 Long-Term Tracking

**For recurring pathworking practice:**

### Create a Session Log Spreadsheet

|------|-----------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
|      |           |              |            |              |                   |

### Pattern Recognition Over Time
- Do certain symbols recur?
- Is depth increasing over sessions?
- Are insights building on each other?
- Are you integrating into daily life?

## 📚 Sample Completed Entry

### Example (for reference):

**Date**: 2025-11-23
**Session**: Garden of Eden ULTIMATE
**Duration**: 55 min

**Immediate Impression**:
"Overwhelming sense of coming home. I didn't realize how long I've been exiled from myself."

**Visual**:
White deer with amber eyes. More real than any waking memory. Felt like seeing my own soul externalized.

**Somatic**:
Heart center: Intense warmth, like sun rising inside chest. Some sadness releasing as tears. Root: Very grounded, heavy, safe. Crown: Tingling, then burst of white light.

**Emotion**:
Joy mixed with grief. Relief. Permission to just BE.

**Insight**:
"The fall wasn't punishment—it was the journey home." I chose this. I chose to forget so I could remember consciously.

**Guide**:
The white deer. Communicated without words: "You've always belonged here." Will try to dialogue with her tomorrow.

**Intention Met?**:
Yes. Sought innocence—found it's not lost, just obscured by shame. Shame releasing.

**Depth**: 9/10 (deepest I've ever gone)
**Time Distortion**: 8/10 (55 min felt like hours)
**Unity**: 7/10 (moments of complete dissolution)

**Key Symbols**:
White deer, rainbow seed, Tree of Life, violet light

**Integration**:
Will draw the deer tonight. Morning meditation with her image. Hand-on-heart when shame arises this week.
