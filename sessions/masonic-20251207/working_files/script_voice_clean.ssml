  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">Imagine stepping into a luminous Masonic temple beneath a star-strewn sky, marble columns etched with spirals and the Flower of Life glowing with soft azure light.<break time="3s"/> The air carries frankincense and cedar, cool and fragrant, as torchlight flickers amber against ancient stone.<break time="3s"/> You hear a distant choir of harmonics, a gentle cosmic hum mingling with the hush of midnight air.<break time="3.5s"/> Your fingertips feel the polished texture of carved symbols, smooth under your touch, radiating a subtle warmth.<break time="3s"/> A chalice of crystalline water rests on an altar; tasting a single drop, it is like sweet mountain snow, crisp and clean.<break time="3s"/> In the center of the temple, a mandala of light unfurls—spirals within squares, circles within triangles, a living geometry breathing with your inhale...<break time="2.5s"/> shimmering with your exhale...<break time="3s"/> shapes softening into view.<break time="3.5s"/>

As you gaze, a luminous Butterfly appears, wings painted with opal blues and golds, fluttering gently around you, the air stirred cool against your skin.<break time="3s"/> The Butterfly lands near your heart, inviting you to <emphasis level="moderate">open</emphasis> to transformation.<break time="3s"/> You may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what no longer serves, just as the cocoon gives way to flight.<break time="3s"/> You can feel a velvety breeze, scented with jasmine and wild honey, carrying the whisper of possibility.<break time="3s"/>

Ahead, a figure of your Future Self approaches, cloaked in starlight, eyes bright with clarity, palms warm as they gently hold yours.<break time="3s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> their calm confidence, noticing the steady rhythm of their breath syncing with yours.<break time="3s"/> The Future Self offers you a golden square-and-compass amulet, its edges smooth, its center etched with a radiant star.<break time="3s"/> Whenever you recall this amulet, you naturally <emphasis level="moderate">align</emphasis> with purpose and composure.<break time="3s"/> Taste a hint of sweet citrus in the air, like sunlit oranges, bright and clean.<break time="3s"/>

From above, The Star Guide descends like a beam of gentle silver light, accompanied by a soft crystalline tone that seems to ring in your bones.<break time="3s"/> Light sparkles across the floor, forming Metatron's Cube, lines of light humming quietly.

And the deeper you go into this light...<break time="1.5s"/> the more natural it feels to soften...<break time="1.5s"/> and the more you soften...<break time="1.5s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> clarity to settle within...<break time="4s"/> even as you float in ease.<break time="3s"/>

The Star Guide traces a spiral in the air; as you follow its movement, you sense warm sand beneath your feet, the temple opening into a moonlit garden of roses and myrrh.<break time="3s"/> Moonlight paints silver patterns on leaves; petals are velvet-soft beneath your fingertips, releasing a sweet, grounding aroma.<break time="3s"/> A nearby fountain trickles crystal water over smooth stones, each drop a soothing note.<break time="3s"/> You inhale, sensing coolness; you exhale, feeling the warmth of inner fire.

Your Future Self guides you to a reflecting pool. Gazing into it, you see pathways of light branching like neural networks, neuroplasticity rewiring in favor of balance and noble purpose.<break time="3s"/> You may <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> the path of ease or the path of wonder, and either choice brings you deeper into mastery.<break time="3s"/> You notice something glowing ahead—a luminous scroll sealed with a butterfly sigil.<break time="3s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">accept</emphasis> this gift now, sensing epigenetic healing as generations of wisdom flow through you.<break time="3s"/> The scroll unfurls to reveal symbols of earth, air, fire, water, and ether, each element humming with energy.<break time="3s"/> Earth steadies your body, water soothes your emotions, fire transforms old patterns, air clears your thoughts, ether connects you to the infinite.

You can go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> into this realization now...<break time="2s"/> or you can linger gently...<break time="1.5s"/> and notice that with every soft breath, you are already going deeper...<break time="1.5s"/> simply by being here...<break time="4s"/> letting alignment double and deepen.<break time="3.5s"/>

The Butterfly now lifts, leaving a trail of gold pollen that feels like warm sunlight on your skin.<break time="3s"/> The Star Guide places a silver key in your hand, cool and smooth, its teeth shaped like a starburst.<break time="3s"/> When you remember this key, you naturally <emphasis level="moderate">unlock</emphasis> clarity and courage.<break time="3s"/> The Future Self nods, and you feel a gentle pressure on your shoulders, steady and reassuring.

In this temple garden, the scent of sandalwood deepens, the sky above swirling with violet and indigo, auroras dancing in slow motion.<break time="3s"/> You hear distant bells like deep bronze, each tone lingering; you taste the sweetness of honeyed tea offered in a cup of carved stone.<break time="3s"/> Touch the cool stone bench beneath you, solid and strong, grounding your journey.<break time="3s"/> As the mandala of light expands, you can <emphasis level="moderate">absorb</emphasis> the wisdom encoded in every line, feeling your neural pathways gently reorganize.<break time="3s"/> In the minutes, hours, even days ahead, insights continue unfolding, weaving into your daily life with ease.<break time="4s"/>

Notice the sacred geometry rotating above—the Flower of Life glowing emerald, the compass and square aligning to a central star, the butterfly wing patterns repeating like fractals across the dome.<break time="3s"/> You may <emphasis level="moderate">invite</emphasis> that harmony into your breathing: inhaling luminous blue clarity...<break time="2.5s"/> exhaling gentle gold reassurance...<break time="3.5s"/> each cycle calming and empowering.<break time="3s"/> With every tone, your inner alignment strengthens.

As you linger here, the Future Self whispers a double-bind: you can transform swiftly like the Butterfly or steadily like the stars in their orbits, and either way, your transformation is assured.<break time="3.5s"/> You may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how choices harmonize, how your mind naturally <emphasis level="moderate">focuses</emphasis> on what matters, how your heart <emphasis level="moderate">trusts</emphasis> its own rhythm.<break time="3s"/>

Take a slow breath. Feel warmth in your chest like a sunlit ember, the scent of rose and cedar entwined, the taste of crystalline water reminding you of purity, the sight of shimmering mandalas, the sound of hushed harmonics.

Let this scene imprint gently, knowing you can return at will. You are safe... you are supported... you are free.<break time="4s"/>
