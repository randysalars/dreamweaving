<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">

Welcome. <break time="1s"/>

I invite you to settle into a comfortable position now, <break time="700ms"/>
knowing that what you're about to experience <break time="500ms"/>
is a journey into a very special place. <break time="1s"/>

Within each of us lives an ancient forest. <break time="1.2s"/>
A place where our deepest instincts dwell, <break time="700ms"/>
waiting to share their wisdom with us. <break time="1.5s"/>

For too long, perhaps, <break time="500ms"/>
civilization has asked us to ignore these primal voices. <break time="1s"/>
To suppress the wild knowing that lives in our bodies. <break time="1.2s"/>
To pretend we are only thinking beings, <break time="700ms"/>
cut off from the ancient intelligence <break time="500ms"/>
that guided our ancestors through countless generations. <break time="2s"/>

Today, you will walk into that forest. <break time="1s"/>
And there, <break time="500ms"/>
you will meet three guides <break time="700ms"/>
who carry different aspects of your instinctual wisdom. <break time="1.5s"/>

The Hunter, <break time="700ms"/> who knows the power of patience and precision. <break time="1s"/>
The Trickster, <break time="700ms"/> who remembers how to play and transform. <break time="1s"/>
And the Wise Animal, <break time="700ms"/> who holds the body's deepest knowing. <break time="2s"/>

Know that throughout this journey, <break time="700ms"/>
you remain completely safe. <break time="1s"/>
You can return to ordinary awareness at any moment <break time="500ms"/>
simply by opening your eyes. <break time="1.2s"/>
But if you choose to continue, <break time="700ms"/>
trust that your instincts will guide you <break time="500ms"/>
exactly where you need to go. <break time="2s"/>

So let us begin. <break time="1.5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">

Allow your eyes to close now, <break time="1s"/>
if they haven't already. <break time="1.5s"/>

And simply notice your breathing. <break time="1.2s"/>
Not changing it. <break time="700ms"/>
Just noticing. <break time="2s"/>

Notice how each breath in <break time="700ms"/>
brings fresh energy into your body. <break time="1.2s"/>
And each breath out <break time="700ms"/>
carries away anything you no longer need. <break time="2s"/>

With each breath now, <break time="1s"/>
allow your body to grow heavier. <break time="1.2s"/>
More relaxed. <break time="1.5s"/>
More connected to the surface beneath you. <break time="2s"/>

Feel that heaviness beginning in your feet. <break time="1.2s"/>
Your feet becoming so pleasantly heavy. <break time="1s"/>
As if roots are beginning to grow from them, <break time="700ms"/>
reaching down into the earth below. <break time="2s"/>

That heaviness spreading now <break time="700ms"/>
up through your ankles. <break time="1s"/>
Into your calves. <break time="1.2s"/>
Rising through your knees <break time="700ms"/>
and into your thighs. <break time="1.5s"/>

Your legs becoming so wonderfully relaxed, <break time="1s"/>
so pleasantly weighted, <break time="700ms"/>
as those roots grow deeper still. <break time="2s"/>

And now that relaxation flowing into your hips, <break time="1s"/>
your lower back, <break time="700ms"/>
softening. <break time="500ms"/>
Releasing. <break time="1.5s"/>

Up through your belly, <break time="700ms"/>
which rises and falls so gently with each breath. <break time="1.2s"/>
Through your chest, <break time="700ms"/>
your shoulders dropping now, <break time="1s"/>
any tension simply melting away. <break time="2s"/>

Down through your arms, <break time="700ms"/>
your hands, <break time="500ms"/>
your fingertips. <break time="1.2s"/>
Everything softening. <break time="1.5s"/>

And finally up through your neck, <break time="1s"/>
your jaw releasing, <break time="700ms"/>
your face smoothing, <break time="700ms"/>
even the tiny muscles around your eyes <break time="500ms"/>
letting go completely now. <break time="2s"/>

Good. <break time="1.5s"/>

You are standing now <break time="700ms"/>
at the edge of an ancient forest. <break time="1.2s"/>
Twilight is deepening around you. <break time="1s"/>
The last light of day <break time="500ms"/>
painting the sky in shades of amber and violet. <break time="1.5s"/>

Before you, <break time="700ms"/>
the forest waits. <break time="1s"/>
Ancient trees rising into the gathering darkness. <break time="1.2s"/>
Mist beginning to curl between their trunks. <break time="1.5s"/>
And somewhere deep within, <break time="700ms"/>
you feel a pull. <break time="1s"/>
Something calling you home. <break time="2s"/>

And now, <break time="700ms"/>
you begin to walk forward. <break time="1s"/>
Step by step. <break time="700ms"/>
Into the forest. <break time="1.5s"/>

With each step you take, <break time="700ms"/>
you move deeper. <break time="1s"/>
And as you move deeper into the forest, <break time="700ms"/>
you also move deeper into relaxation. <break time="1.2s"/>
Deeper into that peaceful state <break time="500ms"/>
where transformation becomes possible. <break time="2s"/>

Ten. <break time="1.5s"/>
Taking your first step onto the forest path. <break time="1s"/>
Soft earth beneath your feet. <break time="1.2s"/>
The sounds of the outer world <break time="500ms"/>
already growing distant. <break time="2s"/>

Nine. <break time="1.5s"/>
Deeper now. <break time="1s"/>
The trees growing taller around you. <break time="1.2s"/>
Ancient sentinels <break time="500ms"/>
who have witnessed countless journeys like yours. <break time="2s"/>

Eight. <break time="1.5s"/>
The mist thickening slightly. <break time="1s"/>
Cool and soft against your skin. <break time="1.2s"/>
Carrying the scent of earth and rain <break time="500ms"/>
and green growing things. <break time="2s"/>

Seven. <break time="1.5s"/>
Deeper still. <break time="1s"/>
The last light of civilization <break time="700ms"/>
fading behind you now. <break time="1.5s"/>

Six. <break time="1.5s"/>
The forest sounds rising around you. <break time="1s"/>
Leaves rustling in a gentle wind. <break time="1.2s"/>
Distant bird calls <break time="500ms"/>
speaking in languages older than words. <break time="2s"/>

Five. <break time="1.5s"/>
Halfway now. <break time="1s"/>
Deeper and deeper. <break time="1.2s"/>
Your body so relaxed. <break time="1s"/>
Your mind so peaceful. <break time="1.5s"/>

Four. <break time="1.5s"/>
The path descending gently. <break time="1s"/>
Taking you into the heart of the forest. <break time="1.2s"/>
Into the place where instincts live. <break time="2s"/>

Three. <break time="1.5s"/>
Almost there now. <break time="1s"/>

Moss-covered stones. <break time="700ms"/>
Trees with trunks wider than houses. <break time="1s"/>

A sound echoes through the trees. <break time="1.5s"/>
A wolf's howl. <break time="1s"/>
Distant but clear. <break time="1.2s"/>

Following the sound, <break time="700ms"/>

Moonlight pools here like liquid silver. <break time="1s"/>
And at the far edge, <break time="700ms"/>
watching you with amber eyes, <break time="1s"/>
stands the Wolf. <break time="2s"/>

The Hunter. <break time="1.5s"/>

Its silver-grey fur seems to shimmer <break time="700ms"/>
in the moonlight. <break time="1.2s"/>
It is perfectly still. <break time="1s"/>
Every muscle relaxed yet ready. <break time="1.2s"/>
The embodiment of patient power. <break time="2s"/>

As you meet its gaze, <break time="1s"/>
you feel something awakening in you. <break time="1.2s"/>
A coiling energy <break time="700ms"/>
gathering in your solar plexus. <break time="1.5s"/>
The feeling of readiness without urgency. <break time="1.2s"/>
Of knowing exactly when to wait <break time="700ms"/>
and when to act. <break time="2s"/>

The Wolf speaks, <break time="700ms"/>

This is the Hunter's gift to you. <break time="1.2s"/>
Available whenever you need it. <break time="2s"/>

You follow the sound <break time="700ms"/>

And there, <break time="700ms"/>
sitting on a moss-covered rock <break time="500ms"/>
with its tail wrapped around its paws, <break time="1s"/>
is the Fox. <break time="2s"/>

The Trickster. <break time="1.5s"/>

Its red-gold fur seems almost to glow. <break time="1.2s"/>
Its eyes hold a spark of mischief, <break time="700ms"/>
of barely contained delight. <break time="1.5s"/>
It looks at you <break time="500ms"/>
as if it knows a wonderful secret <break time="700ms"/>
it's dying to share. <break time="2s"/>

As you approach, <break time="1s"/>
something shifts in your chest. <break time="1.2s"/>
A bubbling sensation. <break time="700ms"/>
Like champagne. <break time="500ms"/>
Like contained laughter wanting to spill out. <break time="1.5s"/>
The feeling of play <break time="500ms"/>
without concern for consequences. <break time="1.2s"/>
Of creative freedom <break time="500ms"/>
uncaged by expectation. <break time="2s"/>

The Fox tilts its head, <break time="1s"/>

<emphasis level="moderate">Seriousness is just another cage.</emphasis> <break time="1.2s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">Play is how the soul breathes.</emphasis> <break time="2s"/>

That bubbling, playful energy. <break time="1s"/>
The permission to be creative, <break time="700ms"/>
spontaneous, <break time="500ms"/>
free. <break time="1.5s"/>
This is the Trickster's gift. <break time="1.2s"/>
Always available when you need to remember <break time="500ms"/>
how to play. <break time="2s"/>

The Fox yips once, <break time="700ms"/>
almost like a laugh, <break time="1s"/>
then bounds away into the undergrowth, <break time="700ms"/>
leaving you with its gift. <break time="2.5s"/>
