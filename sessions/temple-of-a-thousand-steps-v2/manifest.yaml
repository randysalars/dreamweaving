notes:
  creative_direction: |
    This journey focuses on the psychological transformation from "trying to build habits"
    to "being someone who shows up." The mountain steps are literal and metaphorical—
    each step is a day, and the journey reveals that consistency is built one singular
    moment at a time.

    The Patient Monk represents the wisdom of decades of practice—not perfection, but
    persistent presence. The Keeper of the Steps provides witnessing and acknowledgment,
    showing that every attempt matters and is recorded. The 365th-Day Self is the most
    powerful archetype: proof that the transformation is real and achievable.

    The 5 anchors installed during integration should be simple, daily triggers:
    1. Morning breath (3 deep breaths upon waking)
    2. The first step (physical or metaphorical)
    3. Midday check-in (brief pause to reconnect)
    4. Evening gratitude (acknowledging the day's step)
    5. Tomorrow's intention (setting the next step before sleep)

  audio_direction: |
    Maintain alpha dominance (10-11 Hz) to keep energy empowered rather than deeply
    relaxed. Drop into theta (7 Hz) only during the core archetypal meetings to create
    receptivity for identity-level suggestions.

    Use temple bell and mountain ambience to create sacred container. The sub-bass at
    40 Hz provides grounding—essential for an empowerment journey to feel stable, not
    just uplifting.

    Crystal tone sequence at 25:00 should be clear and distinct—5 ascending tones to
    install the 5 anchors, creating an auditory mnemonic.

  script_guidance: |
    Voice should be warm, encouraging, and grounded—not dreamy or overly soft. This is
    an empowerment journey, so maintain presence and conviction.

    Use second-person "you" to create direct experience. Avoid excessive metaphysical
    language; keep it accessible and practical while maintaining the mythic frame.

    The meeting with the 365th-Day Self is the emotional climax—allow space for the
    listener to feel the pride, relief, and certainty of that future identity.
