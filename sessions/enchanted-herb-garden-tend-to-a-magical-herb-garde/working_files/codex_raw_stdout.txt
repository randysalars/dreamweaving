it... pine and memory... like a clean mountain breeze...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nRosemary’s gift is remembrance... and steady focus...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis

like a sunlit hillside...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nHere we frame its “mystical property” safely... as symbolism...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nThyme represents courage... the courage to do small things consistently...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">persist</emphasis>... gently...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\n\nYou water thyme with a few drops from the clay bowl...<break

attention...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nNow basil... glossy leaves... the scent sweet and bright...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nBasil’s gift is vitality... present-moment enjoyment... nourishment...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nYou pick one leaf... and taste it in the imagination...<break time=\"3s\"/>\na green sweetness... slightly peppery... alive...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis

time=\"3s\"/>\nYou remain aware... you remain engaged... you remain you...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">choose</emphasis> wisely...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\n\nAnd now... as you round the spiral path... you see the heart of the garden...<break time=\"3s\"/>\na great tree... roots deep... branches high...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nIt feels like the World Tree...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nAnd you understand this as a metaphor... the nervous system’s stability...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nyour connection between body and mind... earth and heaven...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\n[SFX:

possibilities... into a simple choice...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nOne small next step... the one that honors Christ... honors your health... honors your calling...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">commit</emphasis> to that step... with ease...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\n\nNow... beneath the tree... is a circular bed of roses... not sharp... not threatening...<break time=\"3s\"/>\njust gentle... luminous... open...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nThe air is perfumed... soft and clean...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you see The Rose Mother... framed safely as a symbol...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nrepresenting nurturing love... compassion... and holy tenderness...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nThe kind of love that reflects Christ’s care... steady... patient...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nA mirror appears in the garden...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nvast and luminous... like polished water held upright...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd as you gaze into it... you see yourself... not as you usually appear...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nbut as you at your healthiest... your most grounded... your most kind...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nThis is a symbolic image... a future-paced reminder... of what you’re cultivating...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nWho gazes back at you now?...<break time=\"5s\"/>\n\nNotice the details...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nYour eyes... calm...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nyour shoulders... relaxed...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nyour mouth... soft with peace...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">become</emphasis> more like this... naturally... through practice...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nThe Rose Mother offers you a small gift... a simple token...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nIt could be a rose-gold amulet...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nor a seed packet...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nor a ribbon...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nor a tiny jar of honey...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nNotice what appears... in your own way...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you choose to accept it... or to set it down... either is fine...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nIf you accept it... feel its weight in your hand... its texture... its temperature...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nSmell the rose nearby...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nTaste, if you like, a hint of sweetness... a reminder that goodness is allowed...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd hear the garden... quiet... stable... present...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nNow... the Inner Healer invites you to tend one final bed... your personal bed...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nIt contains three plants... representing three qualities you’re cultivating now...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nPerhaps peace... courage... and focus...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nOr patience... joy... and clarity...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nYou don’t have to decide with words... just notice what grows there...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nYou kneel... and with care... you pull one small weed... not with struggle... but with ease...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you realize... a “weed” is just a pattern... an old habit of attention...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd your brain can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">rewire</emphasis>... because God designed it to learn...<break time=\"3s\"/>\n\nNow you place your hand over your heart... and speak a quiet intention...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nYou can use these words... or your own...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\n“Christ at the center...<break time=\"1.5s\"/>\ntruth in my
