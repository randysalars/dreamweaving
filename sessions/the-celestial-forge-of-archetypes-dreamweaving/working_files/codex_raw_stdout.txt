</prosody>\n\n  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->\n  <prosody rate=\"1.0\" pitch=\"-1st\">\n[SFX: Deep bronze bell, warm, 3s decay]\nAnd now... imagine... or simply sense... a doorway of light...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nNot a portal to unknown spirits...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nbut a holy metaphor... a God-given image... that helps your mind organize truth...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nYou step through... in your own way... in your own time...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you arrive... at the Celestial Forge...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nSee it... as clearly or as softly as you like...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA vast sanctuary... part mountain... part temple... part star-lit workshop...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nHigh arches curve overhead like ribs of light...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd across the ceiling... constellations form a living mandala...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nFlower of Life patterns... turning slowly... like gentle gears...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nMetatron’s Cube hinted in the geometry... not as power... but as a reminder of order... and design... and coherence...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nListen...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nThere is a low, steady hum... like distant strings... or a resonant choir held far away...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA rhythm like a heartbeat...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd in the center... the forge itself...<break time=\"3s\"/>\na bowl of radiant light... not scorching... but warming... like sunrise through amber glass...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nFeel the temperature here...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nWarm on the front of your body... cooler on the back... as if a breeze moves through the hall...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd notice the textures...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nThe floor beneath you is smooth stone... etched with spirals... slightly warm... grounding your feet...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nAnd in the air... there is scent...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\na hint of clean ozone... like after a gentle storm...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nand something softer... like rose and frankincense...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nAnd perhaps... at a fountain carved from crystal... you taste a single sip of water...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nCool... bright... with a faint sweetness... like honeyed spring...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd as you swallow... you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">accept</emphasis> the idea... that what nourishes you... can also transform you...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nNow... in this celestial forge... you notice three workstations... arranged like a triangle...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nEarth... Water... Fire... and Air weaving together... within a fifth... Ether... the quiet space that holds them...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nAnd you understand... these are metaphors... ways of thinking and feeling... held in a safe structure...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nYou notice something glowing ahead...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA gentle light at the edge of the forge... forming into a symbol...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd you can choose... to step closer now...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nor you can wait... and notice you are already closer... simply by paying attention...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd as you approach... you become aware of The Inner Healer...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nNot a being to obey... but a psychological metaphor... representing your God-given capacity to mend... integrate... and restore...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nSee The Inner Healer as a warm presence... perhaps a physician’s calm hands... perhaps a gentle artisan... perhaps simply a radiance in your chest...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">notice</emphasis> what form appears... and let it be yours...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nThe Inner Healer gestures toward a workbench...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nOn it lies a small piece of metal... dull at first...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you realize... it symbolizes an old pattern... a burden... not evil... just heavy...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nSomething you’re ready to refine...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\n[softly] Without strain... you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">release</emphasis> what no longer serves...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nNot by fighting... but by bringing it into the light of truth...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nPlace that symbolic metal into the forge... in your imagination...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd watch the light surround it... not destroying... but purifying...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nLike neuroplasticity in action... the brain updating old predictions... the nervous system learning safety again...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">allow</emphasis> your body to learn... now... that peace is possible...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAs the metal warms... you feel warmth in your chest...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA gentle loosening at the throat...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA sense of space behind the eyes...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd you choose... again... to go at the pace that is right...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\n[SFX: Subtle crystalline tinkles with soft flame crackle, 7s bed]\nNow The Inner Healer offers you a tool... a small hammer of light...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nIt is not power over you... it is a reminder... that your choices shape your life... under Christ...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd as you hold it... you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">remember</emphasis> times you endured...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you can also <emphasis level=\"moderate\">choose</emphasis> a new gentleness...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nA new kindness toward yourself...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nThe kind Christ models... firm in truth... tender in love...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nNow you turn... and notice the second station...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA doorway shaped like a living arch... bark and starlight woven together...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd as you step through... you find yourself before the World Tree...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nIts trunk is immense... textured with ridges like scripture-lines...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nIts branches lift into a sky that looks like deep velvet... scattered with luminous dust...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd you hear leaves whispering... like gentle pages turning...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nHere you meet The World Tree Guardian...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAgain... not a literal spiritual entity... but a metaphor... representing your boundaries... your stewardship... your discernment...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe Guardian might appear as an armored kindness... or a calm sentinel... or simply as the feeling of rootedness in your belly...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">notice</emphasis> the form that arises... without forcing...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nThe Guardian places a hand over the tree’s heartwood...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you sense something ancient and steady... not mystical chaos... but stable order...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nA quiet reminder... that your life has structure... seasons... and wise limits...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nBreathe in... and imagine drawing strength up from the roots...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nBreathe out... and imagine extending calm through your branches...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd as you do... you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">strengthen</emphasis> your boundaries... with love...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe Guardian offers you a key... carved from wood and starlight...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA symbol that means... you can open what is healthy... and close what is draining...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nYou decide... in your own way... what deserves access to your attention...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd now... a fractionation... to deepen integration...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nFor a moment... become aware of the body on the surface beneath you...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nJust notice it...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nAnd now... drift back into the world tree... leaves... stars... roots...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nAnd again... notice your breath in the physical body...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd drift back... deeper into the symbol...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nAnd the deeper you go...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nthe more natural it feels...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nand the more natural it feels...<break time=\"2s\"/>\nthe deeper you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nNow you return... to the Celestial Forge... carrying the key... carrying the rooted calm...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nAnd you notice the third station... a garden within the forge... impossible in the best way... yet gentle...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nA circular bed of roses... lit by soft gold... and moon-white... and blush-pink light...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nAs you step closer... the scent becomes fuller... rose petals... warm earth... a faint spice like cinnamon...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nThe air tastes sweet... like nectar on the tongue...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd you hear a quiet sound... as if each blossom opens with a tiny sigh...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nHere appears The Rose Mother...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA metaphor for compassion... nurture... and wholehearted love... grounded in truth...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nNot worship... not surrendering your will... but receiving the invitation to love wisely... as Christ loves...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nShe may appear as a gentle silhouette... or a warmth around the heart... or hands offering a shawl...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">accept</emphasis> only what is good... only what aligns with Christ...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nThe Rose Mother offers you a single rose...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nNotice its color... perhaps gold... perhaps crimson... perhaps white... perhaps a color you’ve never named...<break time=\"4.5s\"/>\nAnd on the stem... a small charm... a rose-gold amulet... engraved with a simple cross at the center...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nA reminder that Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nRooted in Christ... held in Christ’s unwavering love...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nNow bring the rose close...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nFeel the velvety petals... cool and soft...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nNotice the delicate weight in your hand...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nSmell the fragrance again... deeper now...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nAnd if it feels right... taste a single drop of dew from the petal... sweet and clean...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\n\nAnd as you hold this symbol... you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">forgive</emphasis> yourself for being human...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nYou can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">begin</emphasis> again... as many times as needed...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nYou can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">practice</emphasis> calm courage... one breath at a time...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nNow... at the forge’s center... three lights gather...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nThe Inner Healer’s restoring warmth...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nThe World Tree Guardian’s steady boundaries...<break time=\"2.5s\"/>\nThe Rose Mother’s compassionate love...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nAnd you understand... these are facets of a whole... aligned under Christ... not competing... cooperating...<break time=\"4.5s\"/>\n\nThe forge hum deepens... not louder... deeper... like a cello note in the bones...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nAnd you notice a new object forming...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA small ring... or a coin... or a key-shaped token... of rose-gold light... stamped with sacred geometry around a cross...<break time=\"4s\"/>\nThis is your reminder... not of magic... but of memory... practice... and grace...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd now... one final choice... a gentle double-bind...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nYou can let this lesson settle mostly into your body... as comfort...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nor mostly into your mind... as clarity...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nor both... in whatever proportion feels right...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\nAnd as it settles... you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">notice</emphasis> how naturally your system learns...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nhow easily you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">return</emphasis> to calm...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nand how steadily you can <emphasis level=\"moderate\">act</emphasis> with wisdom...<break time=\"4s\"/>\n\n[SFX: Gentle anvil tap with luminous resonance, 3 taps over 6s]\nAnd in the forge... the final shaping happens softly...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nNot rushed... not forced...<break time=\"3s\"/>\nA simple truth... made durable...<break time=\"3.5s\"/>\nYou are safe... you are
