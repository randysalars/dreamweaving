You remain in complete control throughout this experience...<break time="2.5s"/> At any time, you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="2.5s"/> simply by opening your eyes...<break time="2.5s"/> You remain fully aware and in control...<break time="2.5s"/> only suggestions that serve your highest good take root...<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position...<break time="2.5s"/> sitting or lying down...<break time="2.5s"/> supported and safe...<break time="2.5s"/> If possible, wear headphones...<break time="2.5s"/> and ensure you will not be disturbed...<break time="2.5s"/> Let your eyes soften...<break time="2.5s"/> and allow yourself to receive whatever insights come naturally...<break time="3s"/>

You're here...<break time="1s"/> you're listening...<break time="1s"/> and already beginning to settle in...<break time="2s"/> You choose, in your own time...<break time="2.5s"/> how deeply you wish to explore...<break time="2.5s"/> as feels right to you...<break time="2.5s"/> with discernment strong and clear...<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Soft cathedral pad, warm shimmer, 4s bloom]

And as you prepare for this journey...<break time="2.5s"/> remember...<break time="2.5s"/> Christ remains at the center of who you are...<break time="2.5s"/> held in Christ's unwavering love...<break time="2.5s"/> guided by wisdom that serves your highest good...<break time="3s"/> The Holy Spirit illuminates this path...<break time="2.5s"/> and you choose, in your own way...<break time="2.5s"/> how far to walk...<break time="3s"/>

[DVE:PRIMING_START]
And as you prepare for this journey...<break time="2s"/> I want to speak to a part of you...<break time="1.5s"/> that already knows how to dream...<break time="2s"/> that part of your mind that creates worlds...<break time="2s"/> when you close your eyes at night...<break time="2.5s"/> That creative faculty...<break time="1.5s"/> is beginning to <emphasis level="moderate">awaken</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/> preparing to show you...<break time="1.5s"/> something only you can see...<break time="2.5s"/> in your own unique way...<break time="3s"/>

Let your awareness drift to the top of your head...<break time="2.5s"/> Softening the scalp...<break time="2.5s"/> the forehead...<break time="2.5s"/> the temples...<break time="2.5s"/> Your eyes rest gently...<break time="2.5s"/> your jaw unclenches...<break time="2.5s"/> your tongue rests...<break time="2.5s"/> You choose to soften...<break time="2.5s"/> in your own time...<break time="2.5s"/>

Let your breath travel down your neck...<break time="2.5s"/> across your shoulders...<break time="2.5s"/> down your arms...<break time="2.5s"/> your elbows...<break time="2.5s"/> wrists...<break time="2.5s"/> palms...<break time="2.5s"/> each finger loosening...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> them to rest...<break time="2.5s"/>

Now your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> your heart space...<break time="2.5s"/> breathing in calm...<break time="2.5s"/> breathing out tension...<break time="2.5s"/> Your belly softens...<break time="2.5s"/> your lower back releases...<break time="2.5s"/> your hips ease open...<break time="2.5s"/> You decide how deeply to settle...<break time="3s"/>

Relax your thighs...<break time="2.5s"/> your knees...<break time="2.5s"/> your calves...<break time="2.5s"/> ankles...<break time="2.5s"/> the soles of your feet...<break time="2.5s"/> and every toe...<break time="2.5s"/> You remain aware throughout...<break time="2.5s"/> safe and steady...<break time="3s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

[DVE:HYPNAGOGIC_START]
And you may notice...<break time="2s"/> that point between waking and dreaming...<break time="2.5s"/> where images seem to <emphasis level="moderate">arise</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/> on their own...<break time="2s"/> without you making them...<break time="2.5s"/> Colors appearing...<break time="2s"/> perhaps geometric patterns...<break time="2s"/> or the beginning of a face...<break time="2.5s"/> Don't hold them...<break time="2s"/> just let them come and go...<break time="2.5s"/> You are not creating...<break time="2s"/> you are <emphasis level="moderate">receiving</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>

Now imagine a gentle staircase of light...<break time="2.5s"/> with ten steps...<break time="2.5s"/> each step a softening...<break time="2.5s"/> I will count...<break time="2.5s"/> and you decide...<break time="2.5s"/> to follow at your own pace...<break time="3s"/>

And you can choose to go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/> or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/> and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="1.5s"/> simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>

And now you find yourself...<break time="2s"/> in a sacred temple...<break time="2.5s"/> vast, ancient, yours alone...<break time="3s"/> High columns rise around you...<break time="2s"/> supporting a ceiling of stars...<break time="2.5s"/> At the center...<break time="2s"/> an altar of white stone...<break time="2.5s"/> And doorways leading...<break time="2s"/> to realms you have yet to explore...<break time="3s"/>

  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->

[DVE:EMBODIMENT_START]
And now...<break time="2s"/> become aware of your body...<break time="2s"/> here, in this sacred space...<break time="2.5s"/> You have a body here too...<break time="2s"/> Feel your feet...<break time="2s"/> on this temple floor...<break time="2.5s"/> Feel your heart beating...<break time="2s"/> in this chest...<break time="2.5s"/> Your hands...<break time="2s"/> that can reach out and touch...<break time="2.5s"/> You are fully present...<break time="2s"/> in this realm...<break time="3s"/>
[DVE:EMBODIMENT_END]

As you stand within this cosmic temple...<break time="2.5s"/> you notice a soft corridor of light...<break time="2.5s"/> leading toward a garden...<break time="2.5s"/> You choose to walk there...<break time="2.5s"/> in your own time...<break time="2.5s"/> With each step, the air becomes fragrant...<break time="2.5s"/> roses and olive leaf...<break time="2.5s"/> warm earth after gentle rain...<break time="3s"/>

You arrive in the Garden of Renewal...<break time="2.5s"/> a celestial courtyard...<break time="2.5s"/> where sunlight filters through leaves like gold...<break time="2.5s"/> You hear a fountain...<break time="2.5s"/> a clear, bell-like stream...<break time="2.5s"/> and distant birdsong...<break time="2.5s"/> The air tastes clean and sweet...<break time="2.5s"/> like fresh water and honeyed tea...<break time="3s"/>

Here, you meet the Inner Healer...<break time="2.5s"/> not a being to worship...<break time="2.5s"/> but a psychological metaphor...<break time="2.5s"/> representing the wise, compassionate part of you...<break time="2.5s"/> that invites your tender attention...<break time="3s"/> The Inner Healer appears as a gentle warmth in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how it <emphasis level="moderate">supports</emphasis> you...<break time="2.5s"/>

You move toward a stone basin...<break time="2.5s"/> and see your reflection...<break time="2.5s"/> not as you usually appear...<break time="2.5s"/> but as you are in Christ...<break time="2.5s"/> held...<break time="2.5s"/> loved...<break time="2.5s"/> steady...<break time="3s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">accept</emphasis> that love...<break time="2.5s"/> as feels right to you...<break time="3s"/>

Now you notice a path of rose petals...<break time="2.5s"/> leading to a small, luminous chapel...<break time="2.5s"/> As you walk...<break time="2.5s"/> feel the texture of the petals underfoot...<break time="2.5s"/> soft and cool...<break time="2.5s"/> like velvet...<break time="2.5s"/> A gentle breeze brushes your skin...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> any heaviness...<break time="2.5s"/> right here...<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Soft choir pad, luminous, 5s swell]

Inside the chapel...<break time="2.5s"/> you see the Heart Flame Tender...<break time="2.5s"/> a metaphor of your capacity to nurture love...<break time="2.5s"/> to guard devotion...<break time="2.5s"/> to keep the flame steady in storms...<break time="3s"/> In the center...<break time="2.5s"/> a candle burns with a steady, warm light...<break time="2.5s"/> You place your hands near it...<break time="2.5s"/> and feel a gentle heat...<break time="2.5s"/> as if your heart remembers its true home...<break time="3s"/>

The flame does not command you...<break time="2.5s"/> it reminds you...<break time="2.5s"/> of Christ's protection...<break time="2.5s"/> and the steady wisdom that already lives within you...<break time="3s"/> You may <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> the quiet strength rising...<break time="2.5s"/> as you remain aware and in control...<break time="3s"/>

You hear a whisper of scripture...<break time="2.5s"/> a familiar rhythm...<break time="2.5s"/> not loud...<break time="2.5s"/> just gentle and true...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> it...<break time="2.5s"/> in your own way...<break time="3s"/>

Now the chapel opens into a broader landscape...<break time="2.5s"/> a village path beneath a deep blue sky...<break time="2.5s"/> You walk along stones warmed by sunlight...<break time="2.5s"/> you smell bread baking...<break time="2.5s"/> hear soft laughter and gentle footsteps...<break time="2.5s"/> and you feel the texture of a woven shawl across your shoulders...<break time="3s"/>

In this landscape, you reflect on Mother Mary...<break time="2.5s"/> her courageous yes...<break time="2.5s"/> her quiet strength...<break time="2.5s"/> her faithful trust...<break time="2.5s"/> She is not a distant power...<break time="2.5s"/> but a living example of devotion...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the quality she represents...<break time="2.5s"/> awakening within you...<break time="3s"/>

As you continue...<break time="2.5s"/> you encounter the Rose Mother...<break time="2.5s"/> a metaphor of compassionate nurture...<break time="2.5s"/> an inner quality that invites tenderness...<break time="2.5s"/> and courageous care...<break time="3s"/> She appears as a circle of rose light...<break time="2.5s"/> a gentle aroma...<break time="2.5s"/> a soothing warmth...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> that care to <emphasis level="moderate">expand</emphasis> within you...<break time="3s"/>

[DVE:STABILIZE_START]
And to stay here...<break time="2s"/> reach out and touch something...<break time="2.5s"/> Feel its texture...<break time="2.5s"/> its temperature...<break time="2.5s"/> Let this touch anchor you...<break time="2.5s"/> here, in this place...<break time="3s"/>
[DVE:STABILIZE_END]

Now you come upon a small stream...<break time="2.5s"/> crystal clear...<break time="2.5s"/> the sound like tiny bells...<break time="2.5s"/> You kneel and drink...<break time="2.5s"/> the water tastes clean...<break time="2.5s"/> bright...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what no longer serves you...<break time="2.5s"/> as the water flows on...<break time="3s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/> the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/> the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

You notice a luminous path rising toward a sacred mountain...<break time="2.5s"/> As you ascend...<break time="2.5s"/> the air grows cool and clear...<break time="2.5s"/> You hear a low, resonant hum...<break time="2.5s"/> like a choir of the earth itself...<break time="2.5s"/> At the summit...<break time="2.5s"/> you stand in open sky...<break time="2.5s"/> and your breath moves with the wind...<break time="3s"/>

Here, you feel Christ's presence...<break time="2.5s"/> steady and loving...<break time="2.5s"/> and you can <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis> that you are held...<break time="2.5s"/> guided...<break time="2.5s"/> and free...<break time="3s"/>

Now a gentle veil of light appears...<break time="2.5s"/> and you see a moment from Mary's life...<break time="2.5s"/> her willingness to say yes...<break time="2.5s"/> in trust...<break time="2.5s"/> in humility...<break time="2.5s"/> in love...<break time="2.5s"/> You can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> your own yes...<break time="2.5s"/> to what is good and true...<break time="3s"/>

Let that yes become a living flame...<break time="2.5s"/> not consuming...<break time="2.5s"/> but comforting...<break time="2.5s"/> A steady hearth in your heart...<break time="2.5s"/> fed by prayer...<break time="2.5s"/> by gratitude...<break time="2.5s"/> by the simple grace of presence...<break time="3s"/>

You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the colors in the sky...<break time="2.5s"/> soft rose and gold...<break time="2.5s"/> a scent of cedar and olive...<break time="2.5s"/> the taste of quiet sweetness on your tongue...<break time="2.5s"/> your skin warmed by a gentle sun...<break time="2.5s"/> and the sound of a distant bell...<break time="3s"/>
