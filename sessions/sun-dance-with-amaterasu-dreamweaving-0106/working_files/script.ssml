Welcome...<break time="2s"/>
to this sacred journey...<break time="2s"/>
a Sun Dance with Amaterasu...<break time="2.5s"/>
the radiant goddess of the sun...<break time="2s"/>
the bringer of light...<break time="2s"/>
the illuminator of all that is hidden...<break time="3s"/>

In the next thirty minutes...<break time="2s"/>
you are invited to step into her temple...<break time="2s"/>
to dance in the fire of transformation...<break time="2s"/>
and to discover the light that already lives within you...<break time="3s"/>

You remain in complete control throughout this experience...<break time="2s"/>
At any time...<break time="1.5s"/>
you can return to full waking awareness...<break time="2s"/>
simply by opening your eyes...<break time="2.5s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
Perhaps sitting with your spine gently supported...<break time="2s"/>
or lying down with your body fully relaxed...<break time="2.5s"/>

[SFX: Soft golden shimmer with warm chimes, ethereal, 4s fade-in]

Allow your eyes to close when you're ready...<break time="2s"/>
and take a deep...<break time="1s"/>
nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/>

Breathing in the light of possibility...<break time="2.5s"/>
and breathing out anything you no longer need...<break time="3s"/>

You are safe here...<break time="2s"/>
You are held...<break time="2s"/>
You are guided by wisdom that serves your highest good...<break time="3.5s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And now...<break time="2s"/>
as you settle into this moment...<break time="2s"/>
begin to notice the weight of your body...<break time="2.5s"/>
resting...<break time="2s"/>
supported...<break time="2s"/>
held by the earth beneath you...<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Deep warm drone, solar harmonics, sustained beneath voice]

With each breath you take...<break time="2s"/>
you find yourself drifting...<break time="2s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">deeper</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
into a state of profound relaxation...<break time="3s"/>

Notice your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
and allow any tension there to simply...<break time="2s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>

Your jaw...<break time="2s"/>
softening...<break time="2s"/>
your tongue resting gently in your mouth...<break time="2.5s"/>

Your shoulders...<break time="2s"/>
dropping away from your ears...<break time="2s"/>
as if a warm golden light were melting through them...<break time="3s"/>

This light flows down your arms...<break time="2s"/>
through your elbows...<break time="2s"/>
into your wrists and hands...<break time="2.5s"/>
and your fingers begin to feel warm...<break time="2s"/>
and heavy...<break time="3s"/>

That same golden warmth spreads across your chest...<break time="2s"/>
down through your abdomen...<break time="2s"/>
into your hips and legs...<break time="2.5s"/>

Your thighs...<break time="2s"/>
your knees...<break time="2s"/>
your calves...<break time="2s"/>
all the way down to your ankles...<break time="2s"/>
and your feet...<break time="3s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
I'm going to count down from ten to one...<break time="2.5s"/>
and with each number...<break time="2s"/>
you'll drift twice as deep...<break time="2s"/>
into this peaceful...<break time="1.5s"/>
sacred space...<break time="3s"/>

Ten...<break time="2s"/>
drifting down...<break time="2.5s"/>

Nine...<break time="2s"/>
deeper still...<break time="2.5s"/>

Eight...<break time="2s"/>
letting go...<break time="2.5s"/>

Seven...<break time="2s"/>
so peaceful...<break time="2.5s"/>

Six...<break time="2s"/>
releasing...<break time="2.5s"/>

Five...<break time="2s"/>
halfway there...<break time="2.5s"/>

Four...<break time="2s"/>
deeper and deeper...<break time="2.5s"/>

Three...<break time="2s"/>
almost there...<break time="2.5s"/>

Two...<break time="2s"/>
so deeply relaxed...<break time="2.5s"/>

One...<break time="3s"/>
completely at peace...<break time="4s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now...<break time="2s"/>
you find yourself standing at the edge of a sacred clearing...<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Crackling sacred fire with gentle taiko drums in distance, 5s]

Above you...<break time="2s"/>
the sky glows with the colors of dawn...<break time="2s"/>
soft pinks...<break time="1.5s"/>
radiant golds...<break time="1.5s"/>
and luminous coral light...<break time="3s"/>

The air is warm against your skin...<break time="2s"/>
carrying the scent of cherry blossoms...<break time="2s"/>
and sacred incense...<break time="2.5s"/>

Beneath your bare feet...<break time="2s"/>
you feel smooth stone...<break time="2s"/>
still cool from the night...<break time="2s"/>
but beginning to warm with the approaching sun...<break time="3s"/>

And in the center of the clearing...<break time="2s"/>
stands an ancient altar...<break time="2.5s"/>
carved from white jade and gold...<break time="2s"/>
and upon it...<break time="2s"/>
a flame burns...<break time="2.5s"/>
steady...<break time="2s"/>
eternal...<break time="2s"/>
the Heart Flame...<break time="3s"/>

As you step closer...<break time="2s"/>
you become aware of a presence...<break time="2.5s"/>

She appears before you...<break time="2s"/>
Amaterasu...<break time="2.5s"/>
the radiant goddess of the sun...<break time="3s"/>

Her form is both human and divine...<break time="2s"/>
clothed in robes of gold and crimson silk...<break time="2s"/>
that seem to flow like liquid light...<break time="3s"/>

Her hair cascades down her back like rays of sunlight...<break time="2.5s"/>
and her eyes...<break time="2s"/>
when they meet yours...<break time="2s"/>
are warm...<break time="2s"/>
and filled with infinite compassion...<break time="3s"/>

She smiles...<break time="2s"/>
and extends her hand to you...<break time="2.5s"/>

"Welcome, beloved one,"...<break time="2s"/>
she says...<break time="2s"/>
her voice like the sound of temple bells at sunrise...<break time="3s"/>

"You have come to dance with the sun...<break time="2s"/>
to remember the light that you are...<break time="2.5s"/>
Will you dance with me?"<break time="3.5s"/>

[SFX: Celestial chimes, bright and crystalline, 3s]

And you find yourself saying yes...<break time="2s"/>
because something deep within you recognizes her...<break time="2.5s"/>
recognizes this moment...<break time="2s"/>
as if you have been waiting for it all your life...<break time="3.5s"/>

She takes your hand...<break time="2s"/>
and her touch is warm...<break time="2s"/>
like standing in sunlight after a long winter...<break time="3s"/>

And she begins to move...<break time="2s"/>
and you move with her...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Sun Dance...<break time="3s"/>

It is not complex...<break time="2s"/>
not difficult...<break time="2s"/>
but ancient...<break time="2s"/>
and sacred...<break time="3s"/>

You circle the flame together...<break time="2s"/>
your feet finding the rhythm naturally...<break time="2.5s"/>

Step...<break time="2s"/>
and turn...<break time="2s"/>
and step...<break time="2s"/>
and turn...<break time="3s"/>

And as you dance...<break time="2s"/>
you begin to notice something...<break time="2.5s"/>

With each step...<break time="2s"/>
the light around you grows brighter...<break time="2.5s"/>

With each turn...<break time="2s"/>
you feel warmer...<break time="2s"/>
more alive...<break time="3s"/>

And then...<break time="2s"/>
Amaterasu speaks again...<break time="2.5s"/>

"Notice the shadows you carry,"...<break time="2s"/>
she says gently...<break time="2.5s"/>

And you become aware...<break time="2s"/>
of places within you that have been dark...<break time="2.5s"/>
Places you have hidden...<break time="2s"/>
even from yourself...<break time="3s"/>

Old wounds...<break time="2s"/>
unspoken grief...<break time="2s"/>
forgotten dreams...<break time="2.5s"/>

"Bring them into the light,"...<break time="2s"/>
she invites...<break time="2.5s"/>

And as you continue to dance...<break time="2s"/>
you allow these shadows to rise...<break time="2.5s"/>

Not to fix them...<break time="2s"/>
not to force them away...<break time="2s"/>
but simply to <emphasis level="moderate">see</emphasis> them...<break time="3s"/>

And as each shadow emerges...<break time="2s"/>
Amaterasu's light touches it...<break time="2.5s"/>

And something miraculous happens...<break time="3s"/>

The shadow does not disappear...<break time="2s"/>
but it <emphasis level="moderate">transforms</emphasis>...<break time="3s"/>

What was once a wound...<break time="2s"/>
becomes a source of wisdom...<break time="3s"/>

What was once grief...<break time="2s"/>
becomes compassion...<break time="3s"/>

What was once a forgotten dream...<break time="2s"/>
becomes a seed of new possibility...<break time="3.5s"/>

[SFX: Rising harmonic overtones, healing frequencies, 6s]

And the dance continues...<break time="3s"/>

Faster now...<break time="2s"/>
or perhaps time itself is shifting...<break time="3s"/>

The clearing begins to fill with light...<break time="2s"/>
golden...<break time="1.5s"/>
radiant...<break time="1.5s"/>
warm...<break time="3s"/>

And you realize...<break time="2s"/>
this light is not only coming from Amaterasu...<break time="2.5s"/>

It is coming from you...<break time="3.5s"/>

Your own light...<break time="2s"/>
emerging...<break time="2s"/>
shining...<break time="2s"/>
dancing with hers...<break time="3s"/>

Two flames becoming one...<break time="2.5s"/>
yet remaining distinct...<break time="3s"/>

And she whispers...<break time="2s"/>
"This is who you have always been...<break time="2.5s"/>
Light dancing with Light...<break time="3s"/>
Sun recognizing Sun...<break time="3.5s"/>
Remember this..."<break time="4s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
she guides you to the altar...<break time="2.5s"/>

The Heart Flame burns before you...<break time="2s"/>
steady and eternal...<break time="3s"/>

"This flame,"...<break time="2s"/>
she says...<break time="2s"/>
"is the light of your own heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
It has never gone out...<break time="2s"/>
even in your darkest moments...<break time="3s"/>
It has always been here...<break time="2s"/>
waiting for you to return..."<break time="3.5s"/>

She reaches into the flame...<break time="2s"/>
and her hand passes through it without harm...<break time="2.5s"/>

And she brings forth a gift...<break time="3s"/>

It is a mirror...<break time="2s"/>
but unlike any mirror you have ever seen...<break time="2.5s"/>
Its surface shimmers with golden light...<break time="3s"/>

"Look,"...<break time="2s"/>
she invites...<break time="2.5s"/>

And when you gaze into the mirror...<break time="2s"/>
you do not see your ordinary reflection...<break time="3s"/>

You see yourself as you truly are...<break time="3s"/>

Radiant...<break time="2s"/>
whole...<break time="2s"/>
luminous...<break time="3s"/>

Every part of you glowing with light...<break time="2.5s"/>
even the parts you thought were broken...<break time="3s"/>
even the parts you thought were unworthy...<break time="3.5s"/>

All of it...<break time="2s"/>
bathed in golden light...<break time="3s"/>

And tears may come...<break time="2s"/>
tears of recognition...<break time="2s"/>
tears of relief...<break time="2.5s"/>

Because you are <emphasis level="moderate">seeing</emphasis> yourself...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps for the first time...<break time="3s"/>
as you have always been seen by the Divine...<break time="4s"/>

Amaterasu places her hand on your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>

And you feel a warmth spreading from that place...<break time="2.5s"/>
filling your entire being...<break time="3s"/>

"Carry this light with you,"...<break time="2s"/>
she says...<break time="2.5s"/>

"Whenever you forget...<break time="2s"/>
place your hand on your heart...<break time="2s"/>
and remember this moment...<break time="2.5s"/>
Remember the Sun Dance...<break time="2s"/>
Remember who you are..."<break time="4s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
it is time to return...<break time="2.5s"/>

But you do not return empty-handed...<break time="3s"/>

You carry with you the light of this experience...<break time="2.5s"/>
the warmth of Amaterasu's presence...<break time="2s"/>
and the memory of your own radiance...<break time="3s"/>

As the clearing begins to fade...<break time="2s"/>
you find yourself once again aware of your body...<break time="2.5s"/>

But the light remains...<break time="2s"/>

I'm going to count from one to five...<break time="2s"/>

you need only close your eyes...<break time="2s"/>
place your hand on your heart...<break time="2s"/>
