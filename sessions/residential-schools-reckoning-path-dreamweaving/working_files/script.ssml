You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how your body responds...<break time="2.5s"/>
perhaps the shoulders softening...<break time="2.5s"/>

Let the forehead relax...<break time="2.5s"/>
the eyes resting behind the lids...<break time="2.5s"/>
the throat open and easy...<break time="2.5s"/>

the hands loosening...<break time="2.5s"/>
the belly soft and supported...<break time="2.5s"/>
the hips releasing...<break time="2.5s"/>
the legs unwinding...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the feet resting, warm and steady...<break time="3s"/>
And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>
If you wish... you can go deeper now...<break time="2.5s"/>

  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now... you find yourself in a wide, open meadow...<break time="3s"/>
The air is cool and clean...<break time="2.5s"/>
with the scent of cedar and sweetgrass...<break time="3s"/>
The sky holds a soft, luminous glow...<break time="3s"/>
and you notice a path before you...<break time="2.5s"/>
This is a path of remembrance and renewal...<break time="3s"/>
and you choose how you walk it...<break time="2.5s"/>
with your will engaged... your heart steady... your mind clear...<break time="3s"/>

A gentle wind brushes your skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you can <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> its cool touch...<break time="2.5s"/>
hear grasses whisper...<break time="2.5s"/>
and see golden light move like waves...<break time="3s"/>
As you step forward... the ground is firm and kind beneath your feet...<break time="2.5s"/>
The taste of fresh air is clean and crisp...<break time="2.5s"/>
and somewhere in the distance... a bell-like tone lingers...<break time="3s"/>

You notice a great tree on the horizon...<break time="2.5s"/>
its branches wide... its roots deep...<break time="2.5s"/>
The World Tree Guardian stands as a psychological metaphor...<break time="3s"/>
representing the steady wisdom within you...<break time="2.5s"/>
that holds memory with care...<break time="2.5s"/>
and invites you to <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis> with courage...<break time="3s"/>
You can choose to approach now... or later...<break time="2.5s"/>
and either way, you are supported...<break time="3s"/>

As you near the tree, the bark shows intricate spirals...<break time="2.5s"/>
like sacred geometry...<break time="2.5s"/>
patterns of the Flower of Life shimmering softly...<break time="3s"/>
The tree hums with a quiet resonance...<break time="2.5s"/>
a grounding tone you can hear and feel...<break time="3s"/>
You place your hand on the trunk...<break time="2.5s"/>
noticing its texture... cool, strong, alive...<break time="3s"/>
And you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> any tension you no longer need...<break time="3s"/>

From the tree’s roots, a gentle light rises...<break time="2.5s"/>
forming a path that glows softly at your feet...<break time="3s"/>
As you follow it... you sense a presence of compassion...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Inner Healer appears as a symbol...<break time="2.5s"/>
representing the part of you that knows how to mend...<break time="3s"/>
The Inner Healer offers a calm gaze...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to be held in that gentleness...<break time="3s"/>

[SFX: Soft hand drum with water droplets, 5s decay]
You notice a stream nearby...<break time="2.5s"/>
clear water that mirrors the sky...<break time="2.5s"/>
You kneel and touch the surface...<break time="2.5s"/>
cool and smooth...<break time="2.5s"/>
and as you taste a single drop... it is pure and sweet...<break time="3s"/>
This water symbolizes truth...<break time="2.5s"/>
clear and unclouded...<break time="2.5s"/>
helping you <emphasis level="moderate">see</emphasis> with honesty and care...<break time="3s"/>

Nearby, a garden of roses opens in soft light...<break time="2.5s"/>
The Rose Mother appears as a metaphor of nurturing love...<break time="2.5s"/>
representing tenderness that never abandons...<break time="3s"/>
She is not a spirit to invoke... but a symbolic image...<break time="2.5s"/>
a reminder that compassion can be cultivated...<break time="3s"/>
She offers a rose with petals of deep crimson and gold...<break time="3s"/>
You can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> it... or simply observe it...<break time="3s"/>
and notice what color appears to you...<break time="2.5s"/>
what symbol reveals itself...<break time="3s"/>

As you hold the rose... its scent fills the air...<break time="2.5s"/>
rich and warm...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the softness of the petals against your skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
reminds you that gentleness is strength...<break time="3s"/>
You may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">forgive</emphasis> what can be forgiven...<break time="3s"/>
and to grieve what needs to be grieved...<break time="3s"/>
without fear... without judgment...<break time="3s"/>

Now, you notice a circle of stones...<break time="2.5s"/>
arranged like a mandala...<break time="2.5s"/>
Each stone is a place for truth...<break time="2.5s"/>
for names and stories honored with care...<break time="3s"/>
You can choose to place something here...<break time="2.5s"/>
a breath... a prayer... a word of remembrance...<break time="3s"/>
And as you do... the air shimmers...<break time="2.5s"/>
like light refracting through water...<break time="3s"/>

The World Tree Guardian invites you to look upward...<break time="2.5s"/>
Branches form a canopy of stars...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how your mind becomes spacious...<break time="3s"/>
Entering that calm, creative theta state...<break time="3s"/>
where insight emerges gently...<break time="3s"/>
Neural pathways rewiring...<break time="2.5s"/>
around compassion, clarity, and steady resolve...<break time="3s"/>

You may see a door of light ahead...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you can choose to step through now... or wait...<break time="2.5s"/>
Either way, you are already moving toward healing...<break time="3s"/>
And as you step... you find a quiet hall...<break time="2.5s"/>
lined with shimmering tapestries...<break time="2.5s"/>
Each tapestry is a metaphor for memory...<break time="3s"/>
held with respect... never forced...<break time="3s"/>
You decide how much to look at...<break time="2.5s"/>
and your discernment remains strong...<break time="3s"/>

Here, the Inner Healer offers a small crystal bowl...<break time="2.5s"/>
Inside it, a warm light pulses...<break time="2.5s"/>
This light symbolizes the courage to face truth...<break time="3s"/>
and the power to <emphasis level="moderate">heal</emphasis> what can be healed...<break time="3s"/>
As you hold the bowl... you feel warmth in your chest...<break time="2.5s"/>
steady and grounded...<break time="2.5s"/>
like a hearth that never goes out...<break time="3s"/>

And now... a soft moment of fractionation...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can go deeper now...<break time="2.5s"/>
or you can notice you are already deeper...<break time="2.5s"/>
and either choice brings more calm... more clarity...<break time="4s"/>
Your mind <emphasis level="moderate">settles</emphasis> with ease...<break time="3s"/>

You walk onward to a gentle rise...<break time="2.5s"/>
From here, you see a valley of renewal...<break time="2.5s"/>
where rivers sparkle... forests breathe... and birds sing softly...<break time="3s"/>
You hear their song... like soft flutes in the wind...<break time="3s"/>
You taste the clean air again...<break time="2.5s"/>
and feel sun-warmth on your skin...<break time="3s"/>
This valley is a promise of restoration...<break time="3s"/>
Your heart understands what your mind is learning...<break time="3s"/>

The Rose Mother stands beside you as a symbol of compassionate memory...<break time="3s"/>
She whispers, not as an external voice... but as your own inner wisdom...<break time="3s"/>
“Truth and tenderness can coexist.”<break time="3s"/>
And you can <emphasis level="moderate">accept</emphasis> this truth now...<break time="3s"/>
In your own way... in your own time...<break time="3s"/>

You place your hand over your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
and breathe...<break time="2.5s"/>
Inhale calm...<break time="2.5s"/>
exhale what no longer serves...<break time="3s"/>
And you may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> the healing unfolding...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

[SFX: Soft crystal chime, airy shimmer, 3s decay]
  <!-- INTEGRATION & RETURN -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And now, beginning to return...<break time="2.5s"/>
bringing back with you this feeling of clarity...<break time="2.5s"/>
this steadiness... this compassion...<break time="3s"/>
And in the minutes...<break time="1s"/>
hours...<break time="1s"/>
even days ahead...<break time="1.5s"/>
insights continue unfolding...<break time="3s"/>
as your mind gently reorganizes around what serves you most...<break time="4s"/>
Your discernment is sharpened...<break time="2.5s"/>
the wisdom to recognize truth...<break time="2.5s"/>
the clarity to distinguish what serves you...<break time="3s"/>
You choose how to carry these insights...<break time="2.5s"/>
with your will engaged and your heart open...<break time="3s"/>
Now I’ll count from one to five...<break time="2.5s"/>

Two... feeling the surface beneath you...<break time="1s"/>

  <!-- POST-HYPNOTIC ANCHORS -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
And now, a few anchors to carry this with you...<break time="2.5s"/>
Each time you take three deep breaths... you <emphasis level="moderate">return</emphasis> to calm and clarity...<break time="3s"/>
Whenever you recall the rose in your hand... compassion warms your heart...<break time="3s"/>
When you notice a gentle warmth in your chest... you naturally <emphasis level="moderate">focus</emphasis> on what matters most...<break time="3s"/>
Each time you see a tree... you remember your steadiness and discernment...<break time="3s"/>
And whenever you hear a soft bell or chime... you <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> grounded and present...<break time="3s"/>
