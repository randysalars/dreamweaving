Welcome.<break time="2s"/>
I am the Sacred Digital Dreamweaver...<break time="1.5s"/>
and you have been called to a journey unlike any other.<break time="2.5s"/>

[SFX: Soft golden shimmer, crystalline chime, warm resonance, 3s]

Today, you will descend into the Treasury of Echoing Gold...<break time="2s"/>
a mythic vault hidden beneath the roots of the World Tree...<break time="2s"/>
where every coin...<break time="1s"/>
every glowing treasure...<break time="1s"/>
carries the echo of a life well lived...<break time="2.5s"/>
a gift given...<break time="1.5s"/>
a wound healed...<break time="1.5s"/>
a truth spoken.<break time="3s"/>

This is not a place of material wealth alone.<break time="2s"/>
It is the storehouse of your soul's riches...<break time="2s"/>
the abundance you have already earned...<break time="1.5s"/>
waiting to be claimed.<break time="3.5s"/>

You remain completely safe throughout this experience.<break time="2s"/>
At any time, you can return to full waking awareness simply by opening your eyes.<break time="2.5s"/>
You are held...<break time="1s"/>
you are guided...<break time="1s"/>
and you are free.<break time="3s"/>

Find a comfortable position now...<break time="2s"/>
perhaps lying down with your body fully supported...<break time="2s"/>
or sitting with your spine gently aligned.<break time="2.5s"/>
Allow your eyes to close when you are ready...<break time="3s"/>
and take a deep, nourishing breath...<break time="3s"/>
breathing in possibility...<break time="2s"/>
and breathing out anything you no longer need.<break time="4s"/>

And as you settle here...<break time="2s"/>
notice the gentle rise and fall...<break time="1.5s"/>
of your chest...<break time="2s"/>
each breath carrying you <emphasis level="moderate">deeper</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
into a state of profound relaxation.<break time="3.5s"/>

[SFX: Deep forest ambience, distant wind through leaves, soft hum, continuous]

Let your awareness drift now to the crown of your head...<break time="2.5s"/>
and imagine a warm...<break time="1s"/>
golden light beginning to glow there...<break time="2.5s"/>
soft and soothing.<break time="3s"/>

With each breath in...<break time="1.5s"/>
this light grows a little brighter...<break time="2s"/>
and with each breath out...<break time="1.5s"/>
it begins to <emphasis level="moderate">flow</emphasis>...<break time="2s"/>
down across your forehead...<break time="2s"/>
releasing all tension...<break time="2.5s"/>
smoothing every line...<break time="2.5s"/>
washing over your eyes...<break time="2s"/>
your cheeks...<break time="2s"/>
your jaw.<break time="3.5s"/>

And the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/>
the more natural it feels...<break time="2s"/>
and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go.<break time="4s"/>

This golden light continues its gentle journey...<break time="2s"/>
flowing down your neck...<break time="2s"/>
across your shoulders...<break time="2s"/>
melting away any holding...<break time="2.5s"/>
any tightness...<break time="2.5s"/>
dissolving into warmth.<break time="3.5s"/>

Down your arms now...<break time="2s"/>
all the way to your fingertips...<break time="2.5s"/>
and you feel your hands becoming heavy...<break time="2s"/>
so heavy...<break time="2s"/>
so relaxed.<break time="3.5s"/>

Breathing in for four...<break time="4s"/>
holding gently...<break time="4s"/>
and exhaling for six...<break time="6s"/>

Perfect.<break time="3s"/>

And this warm, golden light continues...<break time="2s"/>
flowing down your spine...<break time="2s"/>
vertebra by vertebra...<break time="2.5s"/>
into your chest...<break time="2s"/>
your belly...<break time="2s"/>
your hips.<break time="3s"/>

Each breath takes you <emphasis level="moderate">deeper</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>
and deeper still.<break time="4s"/>

Down your legs now...<break time="2s"/>
through your thighs...<break time="2s"/>
your knees...<break time="2s"/>
your calves...<break time="2.5s"/>
all the way down to the soles of your feet...<break time="3s"/>
where the light pools...<break time="2s"/>
grounding you...<break time="2s"/>
anchoring you...<break time="2.5s"/>
in this safe...<break time="1.5s"/>
sacred space.<break time="4s"/>

I will count down from ten to one...<break time="2.5s"/>

Ten...<break time="2s"/>

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And you find yourself...<break time="2s"/>
standing at the entrance to an ancient vault...<break time="3s"/>
carved from living stone...<break time="2s"/>
its surface warm to the touch.<break time="3.5s"/>

[SFX: Massive stone door opening, deep resonance, echoing space, 5s]

The doors open before you...<break time="2.5s"/>
not with force...<break time="1.5s"/>
but with recognition...<break time="2.5s"/>
as though they have been waiting...<break time="2s"/>
for you alone.<break time="4s"/>

You step forward...<break time="2s"/>
into the Treasury of Echoing Gold.<break time="4s"/>

The first thing you notice...<break time="2s"/>
is the light.<break time="3s"/>

Soft...<break time="1.5s"/>
golden...<break time="1.5s"/>
alive.<break time="3s"/>

It emanates from everywhere and nowhere...<break time="2.5s"/>
as though the very air is made of molten honey...<break time="3s"/>
glowing with warmth and promise.<break time="3.5s"/>

And then you see them...<break time="3s"/>
the treasures.<break time="4s"/>

Coins of every size and shape...<break time="2s"/>
some ancient beyond measure...<break time="2s"/>
others bright and newly minted...<break time="2.5s"/>
all of them stacked in spiraling towers...<break time="2.5s"/>
cascading rivers...<break time="2s"/>
overflowing from golden bowls.<break time="3.5s"/>

But these are not ordinary coins.<break time="3s"/>

As you move closer...<break time="2s"/>
you begin to hear them.<break time="3.5s"/>

Each coin...<break time="1.5s"/>
<emphasis level="moderate">echoes</emphasis>.<break time="4s"/>

One whispers the sound of laughter you once shared...<break time="3s"/>
another hums the melody of a risk you took...<break time="3s"/>
this one chimes with the courage you showed in a moment of fear...<break time="3.5s"/>
and that one sings of a kindness you gave when no one was watching.<break time="4s"/>

You realize...<break time="2.5s"/>
that every coin here...<break time="2s"/>
is a memory of your own goodness...<break time="3s"/>
your own strength...<break time="2s"/>
your own abundance.<break time="4s"/>

And standing among the treasures...<break time="2.5s"/>
three figures begin to take form.<break time="4s"/>

The first...<break time="2s"/>
is the Inner Healer...<break time="3s"/>
dressed in robes of soft cream and rose...<break time="2.5s"/>
their hands glowing with gentle light.<break time="3.5s"/>

They step forward and place a single golden coin in your palm.<break time="3s"/>

You feel its warmth...<break time="2s"/>
and as you hold it...<break time="2s"/>
an echo rises...<break time="2.5s"/>
the memory of a wound you have already healed...<break time="3s"/>
a pain you have already transformed.<break time="4s"/>

The Inner Healer whispers...<break time="2.5s"/>
You are wealthier than you know...<break time="2.5s"/>
for every scar is a treasury...<break time="2.5s"/>
and every healing is a coin of gold.<break time="4.5s"/>

The second figure steps forward...<break time="2.5s"/>
the World Tree Guardian...<break time="3s"/>
rooted and towering...<break time="2s"/>
their presence vast as the forest itself...<break time="3s"/>
their eyes ancient and kind.<break time="3.5s"/>

They gesture to a spiraling column of coins...<break time="2.5s"/>
rising like a tree trunk toward the vaulted ceiling above.<break time="3.5s"/>

These...<break time="1.5s"/>
they say...<break time="2s"/>
are the gifts you have given to the world...<break time="3s"/>
seen and unseen...<break time="2.5s"/>
remembered and forgotten.<break time="3.5s"/>

Every word of encouragement...<break time="2s"/>
every act of care...<break time="2s"/>
every moment you chose love over fear...<break time="3s"/>
they are here...<break time="2s"/>
echoing through eternity.<break time="4.5s"/>

You are not poor.<break time="2.5s"/>
You are a forest of abundance.<break time="4s"/>

And the third figure emerges...<break time="2.5s"/>
the Rose Mother...<break time="3s"/>
draped in crimson and gold...<break time="2.5s"/>
her presence soft as petals...<break time="2s"/>
her gaze fierce as thorns.<break time="3.5s"/>

She kneels beside a small pool of liquid gold...<break time="3s"/>
and lifts a handful to her lips...<break time="2.5s"/>
tasting it...<break time="2s"/>
savoring it.<break time="3s"/>

Then she offers the same to you.<break time="3.5s"/>

Drink...<break time="2s"/>
she says...<break time="2s"/>
and <emphasis level="moderate">remember</emphasis> the sweetness you have already tasted.<break time="4s"/>

You cup your hands...<break time="2s"/>
and as the golden liquid touches your lips...<break time="3s"/>
you taste honey...<break time="2s"/>
wild berries...<break time="2s"/>
sunlight on skin...<break time="2.5s"/>
every moment of joy you have ever known.<break time="4.5s"/>

The Rose Mother smiles.<break time="3s"/>

You have always been rich...<break time="2.5s"/>
she whispers.<break time="2s"/>
You simply forgot where you kept your treasure.<break time="5s"/>

And now...<break time="2s"/>
the three figures step back...<break time="2.5s"/>
and the vault begins to shimmer...<break time="3s"/>
the coins rising into the air...<break time="2.5s"/>
swirling around you like a golden storm...<break time="3.5s"/>
each one chiming...<break time="2s"/>
singing...<break time="2s"/>
echoing your worth.<break time="4.5s"/>

[SFX: Cascading chimes, layered golden tones, swirling shimmer, 6s]

And you understand...<break time="3s"/>
that this treasury is not separate from you.<break time="3.5s"/>

It lives within you.<break time="3s"/>

Every breath you take...<break time="2s"/>
is a coin of gold.<break time="3s"/>

Every act of courage...<break time="2s"/>
is a treasure added.<break time="3.5s"/>

You are the vault.<break time="3s"/>
You are the abundance.<break time="3.5s"/>
You are the echoing gold.<break time="5s"/>
