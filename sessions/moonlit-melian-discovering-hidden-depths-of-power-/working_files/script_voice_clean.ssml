    You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how easily you <emphasis level="moderate">relax</emphasis>...<break time="2.5s"/>

    Begin at the crown of your head...<break time="2s"/>
    allow the muscles around your scalp to soften...<break time="2.5s"/>
    your forehead smooths...<break time="2s"/>
    eyes resting...<break time="2s"/>
    jaw unclenched...<break time="2s"/>

    and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
    the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
    You find yourself beneath a moonlit canopy...<break time="3s"/>
    the Moonlit Melian...<break time="3s"/>
    a sacred forest where silver light spills through leaves...<break time="3s"/>
    Each leaf is edged with soft luminescence...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and the air is cool and clear...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> the colors...<break time="2s"/>
    deep indigo shadows...<break time="2s"/>
    pale blue glimmers...<break time="2s"/>
    and threads of gold in the moonlight...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You hear the sound of leaves breathing in the night breeze...<break time="2.5s"/>
    soft water nearby...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and a distant, gentle chime...<break time="2.5s"/>

    The air carries the scent of cedar...<break time="2.5s"/>
    damp earth...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and a trace of night-blooming jasmine...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You feel the ground beneath your feet...<break time="2.5s"/>
    cool, steady, supportive...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> that steadiness to rise within you...<break time="2.5s"/>

    A stream is nearby...<break time="2.5s"/>
    its water shimmering like liquid starlight...<break time="3s"/>
    and you dip your fingers in...<break time="2.5s"/>
    noticing the coolness...<break time="2.5s"/>
    the faint taste of clean, mineral water...<break time="2.5s"/>

    Ahead, a gentle path opens...<break time="2.5s"/>
    lined with stones in a spiral...<break time="3s"/>
    and the spiral glows softly...<break time="2.5s"/>
    like the Flower of Life...<break time="2.5s"/>
    guiding you onward...<break time="2.5s"/>

    With each step...<break time="2s"/>
    you feel more centered...<break time="2s"/>
    more grounded...<break time="2s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> the sense of purpose forming...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You notice a luminous doorway...<break time="3s"/>
    formed of moonbeams and gentle mist...<break time="3s"/>
    and you choose...<break time="2s"/>
    in your own time...<break time="2s"/>
    to step through...<break time="3s"/>

    On the other side...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a celestial garden opens...<break time="3s"/>
    with soft grasses that sway like waves...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and a temple of light at the center...<break time="3s"/>

    This is the Cosmic Temple of Maia...<break time="2.5s"/>
    not as a spirit to invoke...<break time="2.5s"/>
    but as a metaphor for God’s creative wisdom within you...<break time="3s"/>
    a symbol of imagination guided by Christ...<break time="3s"/>

    You are held in Christ’s love...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you remain fully aware...<break time="2s"/>
    fully in control...<break time="2s"/>
    choosing how to engage...<break time="2.5s"/>

    The temple floor is cool beneath you...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and in the center...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a pool of luminous water reflects the moon...<break time="3s"/>
    with delicate ripples of light...<break time="2.5s"/>

    As you breathe...<break time="2s"/>
    colors breathe with your inhale...<break time="2s"/>
    light shimmers with your exhale...<break time="2s"/>
    shapes soften into view...<break time="3s"/>

    You may begin to <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> a presence of strength...<break time="2.5s"/>
    Archangel Michael appears as a symbol...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a metaphor for courage and protection within your own God-given heart...<break time="3s"/>
    not a being to summon...<break time="2.5s"/>
    but a reminder of Christ’s protection...<break time="3s"/>

    A gentle, steady warmth surrounds you...<break time="2.5s"/>
    the Guardian Father appears as a symbol of God’s steadfast care...<break time="3s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> that care to strengthen your inner resolve...<break time="2.5s"/>

    The Dream Architect appears as a metaphor for your renewed mind...<break time="2.5s"/>
    your God-designed capacity to create, plan, and build wisely...<break time="3s"/>

    You notice a radiant scroll...<break time="2.5s"/>
    it opens gently...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and words glow upon it...<break time="2.5s"/>
    “You are wise, you are strong, you are guided.”...<break time="3s"/>

    You can <emphasis level="moderate">accept</emphasis> this truth...<break time="2.5s"/>
    in your own way...<break time="2s"/>
    in your own time...<break time="2.5s"/>

    The pool of light invites you to gaze...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and as you look...<break time="2.5s"/>
    you see reflections of your deeper power...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a calm strength without force...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a gentle authority without fear...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a clear will that remains fully active...<break time="3s"/>

    You can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what no longer serves...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> what strengthens you...<break time="2.5s"/>

    There is a staircase of moonstone...<break time="2.5s"/>
    spiraling downward...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and upward...<break time="2.5s"/>
    at the same time...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You can choose to go <emphasis level="moderate">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2.5s"/>
    or you can wait...<break time="2s"/>
    and notice that you are already going deeper...<break time="2s"/>
    simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>

    As you step...<break time="2s"/>
    you feel the texture of the steps...<break time="2s"/>
    cool and smooth...<break time="2.5s"/>
    the scent of incense and fresh rain...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and a faint taste of honeyed light...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You arrive at a chamber of quiet stars...<break time="3s"/>
    where the ceiling is a night sky...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and the floor mirrors the heavens...<break time="2.5s"/>

    In the center...<break time="2s"/>
    a crystalline sphere turns slowly...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and within it...<break time="2.5s"/>
    you see countless paths of possibility...<break time="2.5s"/>

    Your mind enters that theta state of deep creativity...<break time="2.5s"/>
    your neural pathways gently rewiring...<break time="2.5s"/>
    as new, Christ-centered insights arise...<break time="3s"/>

    You can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> these insights to settle...<break time="2.5s"/>
    you can <emphasis level="moderate">notice</emphasis> how they align with truth...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">choose</emphasis> what you carry forward...<break time="2.5s"/>

    The sphere shows a moonlit forest...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a river of silver...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a bridge of light...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and a key resting on the bridge...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You walk to the bridge...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and the key feels warm in your hand...<break time="2.5s"/>
    like sunlight on your palm...<break time="2.5s"/>
    as if reminding you...<break time="2.5s"/>
    that God has already placed wisdom within you...<break time="3s"/>

    You can <emphasis level="moderate">accept</emphasis> this gift...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">trust</emphasis> the guidance you receive...<break time="2.5s"/>

    The Dream Architect appears again...<break time="2.5s"/>
    as a mirror of your renewed mind...<break time="2.5s"/>
    showing you a blueprint of your next steps...<break time="3s"/>
    clear, simple, aligned...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You may hear a quiet instruction...<break time="2.5s"/>
    from within...<break time="2.5s"/>
    a wisdom that arises in Christ’s light...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you choose...<break time="2s"/>
    how to follow it...<break time="2.5s"/>

    The Guardian Father’s presence reminds you...<break time="2.5s"/>
    that you are protected...<break time="2.5s"/>
    steady...<break time="2s"/>
    and guided...<break time="2.5s"/>

    Archangel Michael, as a symbol...<break time="2.5s"/>
    reflects courage within you...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you can <emphasis level="moderate">step</emphasis> into that courage now...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You see a golden amulet...<break time="2.5s"/>
    etched with a gentle cross...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you place it over your heart...<break time="2.5s"/>
    feeling warmth spread through your chest...<break time="3s"/>

    And as you breathe...<break time="2s"/>
    the amulet glows...<break time="2s"/>
    and your power feels calm...<break time="2s"/>
    humble...<break time="2s"/>
    and strong...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You are safe...<break time="2s"/>
    you are supported...<break time="2s"/>
    you are free...<break time="2.5s"/>

    You notice a path returning through the Moonlit Melian...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and you carry your key...<break time="2.5s"/>
    your amulet...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and your renewed clarity...<break time="2.5s"/>

    And now...<break time="2s"/>
    the deeper you go...<break time="1.5s"/>
    the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
    and the more natural it feels...<break time="1.5s"/>
    the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> yourself to go...<break time="4s"/>

    You can <emphasis level="moderate">integrate</emphasis> this power...<break time="2.5s"/>
    quietly...<break time="2s"/>
    faithfully...<break time="2s"/>
    in Christ’s light...<break time="2.5s"/>

    the warmth of courage...<break time="2.5s"/>
    and the peace of God’s presence...<break time="3s"/>

    And your discernment is sharpened...<break time="2s"/>
