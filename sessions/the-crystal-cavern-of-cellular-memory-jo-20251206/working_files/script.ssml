  <!-- MAIN JOURNEY -->
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
    Imagine now a crystalline cavern beneath a living mountain... walls shimmering with iridescent quartz... soft bioluminescent blues and violets casting gentle light...<break time="3s"/>
    The air is cool and pure, scented with mineral sweetness and a hint of frankincense...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You hear subtle harmonic tones... crystals singing a low, soothing chord... droplets echoing with a bell-like purity...<break time="3s"/>
    Underfoot, smooth stone feels steady... a faint warmth pulses up through your soles... as if the Earth itself is breathing with you...<break time="3s"/>
    At the cavern entrance stands The Crystal Keeper... robed in starlit fabric... eyes reflecting facets of compassion... offering a luminous amulet shaped like a flower of life...<break time="3s"/>
    You accept the amulet... its weight a gentle assurance... its warmth a signal of trust...<break time="2.5s"/>
    The Keeper gestures forward... spiral patterns etched in the floor guiding you inward... sacred geometry shimmering with each breath...<break time="3s"/>
    Farther in, The Garden Tender appears... tending crystalline blossoms that emit scents of wild honey and jasmine... their petals glistening with dew tasting faintly of sweet rain...<break time="3s"/>
    The Garden Tender offers a crystal seed... inviting you to plant it in your heartspace... you can <emphasis level="moderate">place</emphasis> it there...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> it glow...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">let</emphasis> it root into vitality...<break time="3s"/>
    As you do, warmth radiates through your chest, spreading like golden sunlight... a gentle vibration aligning with your cellular memory...<break time="3s"/>
    The Wise Elder emerges, leaning on a staff carved with spirals and runes... eyes kind, voice a soothing tone... offering a scroll of remembrance...<break time="3s"/>
    You unfurl the scroll... seeing patterns of past experiences transformed into shimmering strands... you can <emphasis level="moderate">release</emphasis> what is heavy...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">retain</emphasis> what is wise...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">reshape</emphasis> your narrative into light...<break time="3.5s"/>
    Ahead, an inner chamber opens like a crystalline cathedral... pillars of amethyst, selenite, and rose quartz humming softly... the air carries hints of myrrh and clean ozone...<break time="3.5s"/>
    The Soul Star presence descends—a radiant orb above your crown—sparking a cascade of silver-blue light down your spine...<break time="3s"/>
    Light pools in each energy center: a red ember of grounding... an orange glow of creative flow... a golden sun of confidence... a green emerald of compassion... a blue stream of truth... an indigo star of intuition... a violet halo of infinite connection...<break time="4s"/>
    You can <emphasis level="moderate">invite</emphasis> each center to harmonize...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">allow</emphasis> every cell to drink in light...<break time="2.5s"/> you can <emphasis level="moderate">feel</emphasis> coherence weaving through you...<break time="3s"/>
    The Healer archetype, a luminous figure with hands like warm starlight, touches your shoulders... gentle heat spreading through fascia, muscle, bone...<break time="3s"/>
    With each touch, old imprints dissolve like mist... replaced by clarity and strength...<break time="2.5s"/>
    You notice something glowing ahead... a crystalline pool reflecting a mandala of your cellular lineage... shimmering with colors of emerald, sapphire, and gold...<break time="3s"/>
    Kneeling by the pool, you taste a drop of the water—cool, pure, with a hint of sweet mineral nectar—and feel it resonate through your cells...<break time="3s"/>
    The Observer Self steps forward—your higher witnessing awareness—calm, compassionate, spacious... inviting you to watch as memories transform into light...<break time="3s"/>
    You can choose to go <emphasis level="strong">deeper</emphasis> now...<break time="2s"/> or you can wait...<break time="1.5s"/> and notice that you are already going deeper... simply by listening...<break time="4s"/>
    The deeper you drift into this radiant awareness... the more vividly you feel renewed... and the more renewed you feel... the deeper you <emphasis level="moderate">sink</emphasis> into serenity...<break time="4s"/>
    Fragrance of sacred copal wafts through... sound of distant chimes blending with a gentle cosmic hum... cool stone beneath your hands... soft warmth across your chest... the faint taste of crystalline mist upon your lips...<break time="4s"/>
    The Crystal Keeper presents three gifts: a clear quartz key for clarity, a rose quartz heart for compassion, an amethyst spiral for protection...<break time="3.5s"/>
    You <emphasis level="moderate">receive</emphasis> clarity...<break time="2.5s"/> you <emphasis level="moderate">embody</emphasis> compassion...<break time="2.5s"/> you <emphasis level="moderate">carry</emphasis> protection...<break time="3s"/>
    Feel every cell gently pulsing with light... neural pathways <emphasis level="moderate">rewiring</emphasis> toward vitality... epigenetic patterns <emphasis level="moderate">releasing</emphasis> what no longer serves... quantum possibilities <emphasis level="moderate">aligning</emphasis> with your desired reality...<break time="4s"/>
    The Garden Tender guides you to plant the crystal seed within the cavern floor... roots of light linking cavern and heart... Earth and body...<break time="3s"/>
    The Wise Elder nods, affirming your renewed story... The Soul Star shines brighter, sealing coherence... The Observer Self smiles, serene...<break time="3s"/>
    Breathe in luminous light...<break time="3s"/> breathe out residual heaviness...<break time="3s"/> breathe in crystalline harmony...<break time="3s"/> breathe out anything unneeded...<break time="3s"/>
    In the moments... minutes... even days ahead... this harmony continues to unfold, integrating through your body and life...<break time="4s"/>
