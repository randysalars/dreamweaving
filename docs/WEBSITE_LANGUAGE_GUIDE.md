# Website Language Guide

High-integrity ethical persuasion system for salars.net and all Sacred Digital Dreamweaver content.

## Philosophy

> "Never use language to create a need that your language then satisfies."

This is persuasion through resonance, not extraction. Your website is not a machine for extracting action—it is a place that teaches people how to feel safe again.

**Core Principle:** Ethical persuasion doesn't convince people to move faster. It makes them feel safe enough to move at all.

## Voice Constitution (7 Non-Negotiable Laws)

These govern ALL website copy. No exceptions.

| # | Law | Test |
|---|-----|------|
| 1 | **Agency First** | "if you want / at your pace" precedes any ask |
| 2 | **Low Demand** | no hype, no forced outcomes, no "must" |
| 3 | **Trust Calibration** | "what this is / isn't" present on offer pages |
| 4 | **Timelessness** | remove urgency; prefer "return / remain" |
| 5 | **Exit-Forward** | unsub/leave is dignified, obvious, one click |
| 6 | **Meaning-Open** | avoid over-explaining; allow ambiguity |
| 7 | **No Extraction** | never create a need you then satisfy |

---

## Forbidden Language (Hard No List)

**NEVER** use these patterns on our site:

### Urgency
- Countdown timers
- "Only X spots left"
- "Don't miss out"
- "Last chance"
- "Limited time"
- "Act now"

### Manipulation
- Emotional guilt ("support us or else...")
- Identity shaming ("people like you do...")
- Fear-based framing
- FOMO language

### Hyperbole
- "This will change your life"
- "Guaranteed results"
- "Revolutionary"
- "Never seen before"

### Commands
- "You will now..."
- "You must..."
- "You need to..."

## Page Archetypes

Every page has a defined role. Know which archetype you're writing for.

### Field Pages (Homepage, About)

**Purpose:** Set tone

**Rules:**
- No offers above the fold
- At least one refusal-first line
- One anti-utility statement
- Use field-setting statements
- Narrative gravity language

**Example Copy:**
```
A place for returning.

Nothing here is urgent.
This space exists for slowing down.

For those who sense there's more depth available than what most content offers.

If this isn't for you, that's fine.
```

### Invitation Pages (Newsletter, Library, Explore)

**Purpose:** Soft engagement

**Rules:**
- Consent gradient visible
- No scarcity language
- Exit-forward microcopy present
- Multiple engagement levels

**Example Copy:**
```
Receive quiet notes (optional)

No urgency. No noise. Just something to return to.

Choose your rhythm:
[ ] Weekly
[ ] Monthly
[ ] Only special releases

Unsubscribe anytime. One click.
```

### Offering Pages (Dreamweavings, Sessions)

**Purpose:** Exchange

**Rules:**
- "What this is / isn't" mandatory
- "For whom / not for whom" required
- No outcome guarantees
- CTA cluster (soft → direct)

**Required Block:**
```
## What This Is
- A guided space for emotional release
- 25 minutes of intentional stillness
- Binaural frequencies designed to support nervous system regulation

## What This Isn't
- Not a replacement for therapy or medical treatment
- Not a quick fix
- Not something you need to "do right"

## Works Best When
- You have uninterrupted time
- You're open to what arises
- You return more than once
```

### Threshold Pages (Checkout, Confirmation)

**Purpose:** Transitions

**Rules:**
- Anxiety-reducing language
- Explicit permission to leave
- Clear next step or rest
- No upsells that pressure

---

## Consent Gradient

Never jump from Level 0 → Level 4 on the same screen.

| Level | Name | Asks | Language Markers |
|-------|------|------|------------------|
| 0 | Browse | Nothing | — |
| 1 | Receive | Newsletter (soft) | "Receive reflections like this" |
| 2 | Return | Bookmark, follow | "This will be here" |
| 3 | Engage | Listen/watch full piece | "~25 minutes" |
| 4 | Offer | Purchase/donate | "Begin when ready" |
| 5 | Belong | Membership/community | "Join this space" |

---

## Copy Component Library

Drop-in blocks for consistent language across the site.

### 1. Safety Header (1-2 lines)

Use early on pages, above the fold:

```
No rush. This will still be here.
```
```
There's nothing you need to decide right now.
```
```
Take your time with this.
```

### 2. Refusal-First Line (optional but powerful)

```
This may not be for you.
```
```
It's okay if this doesn't resonate.
```
```
You won't miss anything by leaving.
```

### 3. Trust Calibration Block

```
## What This Is
[3 bullets]

## What This Isn't
[3 bullets]

## Works Best When
[3 bullets]
```

### 4. Consent Gradient CTA Group (3-tier)

```
Soft:    "Explore" | "Receive reflections"
Medium:  "Begin gently" | "Listen when ready"
Direct:  "Enter" | "Begin" | "Choose this experience"
```

### 5. Exit-Forward Microcopy

```
Unsubscribe anytime. No hard feelings.
```
```
Close this whenever you like.
```
```
You can step away anytime. This door stays open.
```

### 6. Silence Marker

Use between sections, before forms, before CTAs:

```
—
```
```
This is a good place to stop for a moment.
```
```
Nothing else needs to happen here.
```

### 7. Meaning Scaffold

```
Take what helps. Leave the rest.
```
```
Meaning tends to reveal itself over time.
```
```
You don't have to understand this yet.
```

## CTA Transformations

Replace standard CTAs with ethical alternatives:

| Standard | Ethical |
|----------|---------|
| Sign up | Receive |
| Buy now | Begin |
| Submit | Send |
| Learn more | Explore |
| Get started | Enter |
| Join | Stay connected |
| Subscribe | Receive reflections |
| Download | Access |
| Register | Join gently |
| Add to cart | Choose this |

---

## Channel-Specific Language

### Website

- **Approach:** Ambient persuasion
- Use open loops without urgency
- Speak in second person, gently
- CTAs = verbs of agency, not compliance
- White space is persuasion
- Fewer CTAs = more trust

**Good CTAs:** Enter, Begin gently, Explore this space

### Email

- **Approach:** Relational, not promotional

**Subject Lines:**
- "A quiet invitation"
- "Something you can return to anytime"
- "Just leaving this here"

**Openers:**
- "Just leaving this here for you."
- "No response needed."
- "Read this whenever it's convenient."

**Closings:**
- "Take care."
- "No need to reply."
- "This will be here."

### Social Media

- **Approach:** Signal > persuasion
- Your goal is resonance, not conversion
- Statements, not arguments
- Reflection, not instruction

**Example Posts:**
- "Not everything meaningful is loud."
- "Some things arrive when we stop chasing them."
- "Depth doesn't hurry."

## Implementation Workflow

### For New Pages

1. **Identify archetype** (Field, Invitation, Offering, Threshold)
2. **Add Safety Header** above the fold
3. **Include Trust Calibration** if offering anything
4. **Use Consent Gradient** for CTAs (don't jump levels)
5. **Add Exit-Forward** microcopy where relevant
6. **Remove** urgency, scarcity, hyperbole
7. **Review** against Voice Laws

### For Existing Pages

Run this audit:

1. **Demand Load Audit**
   - Does it pressure? (0-3)
   - Does it offer choice? (0-3)
   - Time pressure? (0-3)
   - Interpretation pressure? (0-3)

2. **Identify Forbidden Patterns**
   - Urgency language?
   - Scarcity language?
   - Hyperbole?
   - Commands?

3. **Apply Fixes**
   - Replace urgency with timelessness
   - Replace commands with invitations
   - Add refusal-first lines
   - Add trust calibration block

---

## Language Governance

### Quarterly Audit Process

Every 90 days:

1. **Print/view key pages**
2. **Highlight:**
   - Urgency
   - Explanation bloat
   - Identity capture
   - Clever-sounding lines
3. **Remove 20-30% of words**
4. **Insert silence markers**
5. **Do not replace removed text immediately**

**Rule:** Reduction beats rewriting.

### Language Debt Indicators

Signs your copy needs audit:

- More adjectives than verbs
- More claims than invitations
- CTAs multiplying
- Explanations getting longer
- Copy trying to "prove" itself
- Silence disappearing
- Lines starting to feel "clever"

### Anti-Corruption Protocol

When someone suggests "pushing harder":

1. What would break trust?
2. What would reduce agency?
3. What would create pressure instead of invitation?
4. Is the short-term gain worth the field damage?

**If unsure—do nothing.** Inaction is often the ethical move.

---

## Measurement (Trust Metrics)

### Track These

- Return rate (7/14/30 days)
- Email reply rate (warmth signal)
- Unsubscribe rate after promotions
- Time-to-first-return
- Conversion rate by consent level

### Avoid Optimizing For

- Pop-up capture rate alone
- Urgency-driven spikes
- Immediate conversion

These poison the field long-term.

---

## The Tests

Before publishing, ask:

### Agency Test
> "Does this increase or reduce choice?"

### Prediction Test
> "Does it raise or lower expected pressure?"

### Residue Test
> "Will anything quiet remain after reading?"

### Consent Test
> "Would this feel respectful if the reader were vulnerable, tired, or grieving?"

### Deepest Test
> "Would this feel right if the reader never bought anything?"

---

## Integration with Automation

### Python Access

```python
from scripts.ai.knowledge_tools import load_website_language_codex

codex = load_website_language_codex()
print(codex["phrase_categories"]["safety_low_demand"]["phrases"])
```

### AI Generation Rules

When generating website copy via AI:

1. Load `website_language_codex.yaml` into context
2. Reference appropriate phrase categories
3. Validate against forbidden_language patterns
4. Apply Voice Laws as constraints
5. Use consent gradient for CTAs

## The North Star

> "Your website is not a machine for extracting action. It is a place that teaches people how to feel safe again."

When in doubt, ask:

> "Never say something that would still work if the user removed their agency."

If it would—rewrite it.
