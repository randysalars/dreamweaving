            <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Grounding and spiritual awareness operate synergistically rather than in opposition. Being present in physical reality enhances rather than diminishes connection to expanded consciousness states.

              Why This Matters
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This integration occurs because grounding provides the stable foundation necessary for processing higher states of awareness without dissociation or overwhelm. The nervous system requires embodied presence to safely navigate expanded consciousness, while spiritual awareness brings meaning and context to grounded experience. This demonstrates that transcendence and immanence are complementary aspects of integrated consciousness rather than competing orientations.

              Where This Changes
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The balance shifts during intense spiritual experiences where temporary disconnection from physical awareness may occur, or during trauma responses where grounding takes precedence over expanded states. Individual capacity for simultaneous integration varies based on nervous system regulation and practice.
