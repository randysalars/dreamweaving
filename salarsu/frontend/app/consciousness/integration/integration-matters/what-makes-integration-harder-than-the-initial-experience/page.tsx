            <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Integration requires sustained effort against established neural patterns and social conditioning, while initial experiences often occur in protected, temporary states with reduced psychological defenses.

              Why This Matters
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Peak experiences frequently happen during altered states where normal cognitive filters are temporarily suspended, creating openings for new perspectives. Integration, however, demands rewiring entrenched neural pathways while navigating daily responsibilities, social expectations, and the brain's tendency to revert to familiar patterns. This process requires conscious, repeated effort because the default mode network and existing belief systems actively resist change that threatens their established functioning.

              Where This Changes
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Integration becomes easier when individuals have strong support systems, structured practices, or when the initial experience was particularly profound and created lasting neural changes. Some people also demonstrate natural neuroplasticity that facilitates faster pattern reorganization.
