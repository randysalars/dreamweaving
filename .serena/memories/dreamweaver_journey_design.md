## Journey Structure

### Core Sections (7 Parts)

Every Dreamweaver journey follows this structure:

| Section | Duration | Purpose | Depth |
|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Pre-Talk** | 2-3 min | Safety, consent, grounding | Surface |
| **Induction** | 4-5 min | Progressive relaxation, entering trance | Descending |
| **Deepening** | 2-3 min | Deepen trance, countdown or stairs | Deep |
| **Journey** | 10-15 min | Main hypnotic experience, visualizations | Deep-Deepest |
| **Helm (Deepest)** | 3-5 min | Peak experience, revelation, transformation | Deepest |
| **Integration** | 2-3 min | Process, anchor, prepare for return | Ascending |
| **Post-Hypnotic** | 2-3 min | Suggestions, emergence, grounding | Surface |

### Section Details

#### 1. Pre-Talk (2-3 minutes)
**Purpose:** Establish safety, consent, and preparation

**Must Include:**
- Welcome and grounding
- Permission to return to wakefulness at any time
- Physical comfort check
- Setting intention
- Brief overview of what to expect

**Prosody:** `rate="1.0"`, `pitch="0st"`, breaks 700ms-1.0s

**Example Elements:**
```
- "Welcome to this sacred journey..."
- "At any moment, you can return to full wakefulness..."
- "Find a comfortable position..."
- "Set your intention for this experience..."
```

#### 2. Induction (4-5 minutes)
**Purpose:** Guide into trance state through progressive relaxation

**Techniques:**
- Breath awareness
- Body scan (head to toe or toe to head)
- Eye fixation and closure
- Counting down
- Imagery of descent (stairs, elevator, path)

**Prosody:** `rate="1.0"`, `pitch="-2st"`, breaks 1.0s-1.7s

**Pattern:** Each breath deeper, each number lower, each step further

#### 3. Deepening (2-3 minutes)
**Purpose:** Intensify trance state before main journey

**Techniques:**
- Countdown (10 to 1, or 5 to 1)
- Staircase or elevator descent
- "Going deeper now" suggestions
- Waves of relaxation
- Doubling depth

**Prosody:** `rate="1.0"`, `pitch="-2st"`, breaks 1.7s-2.5s

#### 4. Journey (10-15 minutes)
**Purpose:** Main experiential content

**Structure:**
- Environmental description (setting the scene)
- Sensory engagement (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)
- Narrative progression (beginning, middle, climax approach)
- Archetypal encounters (guides, symbols, entities)
- Interactive elements (choices, actions, receiving)

**Prosody:** `rate="1.0"`, `pitch="-1st"`, breaks 1.0s-2.0s

**Key Principle:** Show, don't tell. Create space for listener's imagination.

#### 5. Helm/Deepest (3-5 minutes)
**Purpose:** Peak transformational experience

**Elements:**
- Climactic revelation or encounter
- Energy transfer or activation
- Symbolic transformation
- Gift or message receiving
- Highest archetypal connection

**Prosody:** `rate="1.0"`, `pitch="-2st"`, breaks 2.0s-3.0s

**This is the heart of the journey - where the real magic happens.**

#### 6. Integration (2-3 minutes)
**Purpose:** Process experience and prepare for return

**Elements:**
- Acknowledge what was received
- Allow insights to settle
- Create anchor for future access
- Gradual shift from deep to medium trance
- Gratitude and closing of sacred space

**Prosody:** `rate="1.0"`, `pitch="-1st"`, breaks 1.5s-2.0s

#### 7. Post-Hypnotic (2-3 minutes)
**Purpose:** Suggestions and full emergence

**Elements:**
- Post-hypnotic suggestions (what carries forward)
- Counting up (1 to 5 or 1 to 10)
- Body reactivation
- Eye opening
- Grounding in present moment
- Encouragement and completion

**Prosody:** `rate="1.0"`, `pitch="0st"`, breaks 700ms-1.0s

## Narrative Techniques

### 1. Sensory Layering
Always engage multiple senses:
```
SIGHT: "See before you a garden of crystalline flowers..."
SOUND: "Hear the gentle chiming of celestial bells..."
SMELL: "Notice the sweet fragrance of sacred incense..."
TOUCH: "Feel the cool mist upon your skin..."
TASTE: "Taste the honey of divine wisdom upon your lips..."
```

### 2. Present Tense Immersion
Always use present tense for journeys:
```
CORRECT: "You are walking along a golden path..."
WRONG: "You were walking along a golden path..."
```

### 3. Embedded Commands
Natural suggestions within descriptions:
```
"As you RELAX DEEPER NOW, the light grows brighter..."
"With each breath, you FEEL MORE PEACEFUL..."
```

### 4. Metaphorical Language
Transform abstract concepts into sensory experiences:
```
"Your worries dissolve like morning mist..."
"Peace settles into your heart like warm honey..."
"Your spirit rises like a phoenix from sacred flames..."
```

### 5. Spacing for Visualization
Leave generous breaks for internal experience:
```
Allow the image to form in your own way... <break time="3s"/>
```

### 6. Choice Architecture
Offer choices that empower:
```
"You may take the path of light or the path of stars... 
 knowing both lead to the same sacred destination..."
```

## Technical Requirements

### SSML Structure
```xml
<speak>
  <!-- Section marker for reference -->
  
  <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="[section pitch]">
    Spoken content here... <break time="1.5s"/>
    More content... <break time="2s"/>
  </prosody>
  
</speak>
```

### Timing Calculations
- Average speaking rate: ~150 words/minute at rate="1.0"
- For 25-minute journey: ~3,750 words (including breaks)
- Break time adds ~15-20% to total duration

### Break Placement Guidelines
- After every 1-2 sentences in journey content
- Longer breaks after visualization prompts
- Extra-long breaks (3-5s) at peak moments
- Shorter breaks (700ms) during transitions

- [ ] Consent and exit option stated
- [ ] Sensory descriptions engage 3+ senses
- [ ] Present tense throughout journey content
- [ ] Appropriate prosody for each section
- [ ] Breaks create natural rhythm
- [ ] Archetypes are coherent and serve the theme
- [ ] Peak experience is transformational
- [ ] Integration anchors the experience
- [ ] Post-hypnotic suggestions are positive

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Much Talking** - Leave space for inner experience
2. **Rushing Induction** - Take time to establish trance
3. **Weak Deepening** - Don't skip straight to journey
4. **Telling Not Showing** - "You feel peaceful" vs "Peace flows through you"
5. **Missing Safety** - Always include exit option
6. **Abrupt Transitions** - Use bridges between sections
7. **Flat Climax** - Helm must be the peak experience
8. **Rushed Emergence** - Bring them back gently
9. **Slowing the Rate** - Use rate="1.0", create pace with breaks
10. **No Grounding** - Always end fully present
