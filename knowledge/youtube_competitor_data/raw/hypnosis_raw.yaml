    ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response; it’s a feeling you get from
    hearing, watching, and feeling certain stimuli that gives you a “tingle” in your
    head. The good stuff helps you relax, calm down, and even fall asleep✨


    Here’s hoping my videos will bring you lots of tingles and relaxation. Please

    Ive been performing since I was around 12 years old and did my first show when
    I was 14. From a young age I''ve always had a sense that I could read situations
    and people differently than others. When I was 18 years old my Dad was hypnotized
    to quit smoking. I was fascinated by this and as I begin researching and studying
    hypnosis I realized that this was a gift I also had. Since then I''ve continued
    perfecting and honing my craft everyday, learning more about the mind, human nature
    and influence. I perform primarily at corporate events and conferences around
    the world, I give keynotes on body language and influence, and have even been
    called to demonstrate my unique talents before two Department of Defense Intelligence
    Agencies. I also perform for my audience of over 1 million across TikTok, Instagram,
    Fb, and Youtube. My two primary talents are the ability to read people and to
    influence decisions.

  description: 'If stress and overthinking are keeping you awake, it’s time to give
    this simple yet effective technique a try.


    Developed by Dr. Andrew Weil and inspired by ancient yogic practices, the 4-7-8
    method uses controlled breathing to activate your body’s “rest-and-digest” mode,
    helping you relax and sleep better.


    Here’s how it works:


    Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds.

    Hold your breath for 7 seconds.

    Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds.


    This method slows your heart rate, lowers blood pressure, and reduces stress hormones,
    creating the perfect conditions for restful sleep.


    It’s not just about better sleep, studies show it can also reduce anxiety. Give
    it a try tonight and experience the difference. 😴'

  description: 'Dive into an ultra-soothing ocean world where jellyfish, octopus and
    coral become pure ASMR. Gentle waves meet delicate textures and micro-movements
    to trigger tingles and help you switch off fast. Expect soft swirls, bubble pops
    and watery rustle layered with careful sound design so your brain can slow down
    and drift. This short blends visual calm + tactile cues, perfect for bedtime,
    study breaks or a mindful reset.

    Tell me which sea moment hit you hardest — the jellyfish drape, octopus glide
    or reef sparkle? Your comment helps the algorithm surface this to more sleepy
    ocean lovers. If this helped, subscribe and explore our Ocean ASMR playlist for

  description: "Whether you're winding down at bedtime or lying awake in the middle\
    \ of the night, this meditation is here to help you let go, unwind, and invite\
    \ restful sleep. It features gentle pink noise in the background, and the volume\
    \ gets a little quieter as the night goes on, helping your nervous system relax\
    \ even more deeply as you drift toward rest.\n\nIntroduction – 0:00\nMeditation\
    \ Begins – 5:28\n\nGuided by Chibs Okereke—a stress and burnout coach, mindfulness\
    \ facilitator, and Calm app narrator—this soothing practice activates the vagus\
    \ nerve, your body's internal switch for calm. You'll move through gentle breathwork,\
    \ balanced breathing, and a full-body scan designed to help your nervous system\
    \ settle so sleep can arrive naturally.\n\nThere’s nothing to force. No pressure\
    \ to sleep. Just a safe space to relax deeply and allow your body to return to\
    \ rest.\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\n• Vagus nerve activation through breathwork\n• Balanced\
    \ breathing to signal safety\n• A full-body scan to release tension\n• Soothing,\
    \ steady narration to help you unwind\n• Subtle pink noise that gently fades as\
    \ the night progresses\n\nWhy the Vagus Nerve?\nEngaging the vagus nerve helps\
    \ activate the parasympathetic nervous system, signaling to your body that it’s\
    \ time to relax and rest. This approach not only prepares you for immediate rest\
    \ but also contributes to long-term resilience against stress.\n\nAs the session\
    \ ends, if you haven’t already drifted off, you’ll find yourself ready to fall\
    \ into a deep, peaceful sleep. Remember, sleep arises naturally under the right\
    \ conditions, and tonight, I create those conditions just for you.\n\n---------------------------------\n\

    repair, mental rejuvenation, and overall well-being, leaving you feeling refreshed
    and balanced.

    a peaceful and comfortable environment.

    deep relaxation.

  description: 'This sleep hypnosis helps you fall asleep within minutes and also
    supports better long-term sleep. To do this, we will use powerful relaxation techniques
    that help you let go of distracting thoughts and relax your muscles. This hypnosis
    can also help with long-term sleep issues / insomnia, if you listen to it for
    21 days or longer. I wish you a restful sleep… 😴


    What does this sleep hypnosis help with? ✔️ Falling asleep quickly and gently
    ✔️ Sleeping better in the long term ✔️ Switching off and letting go of distracting
    thoughts ✔️ Waking up refreshed with a positive start to the new day


    This hypnosis is longer than the usual hypnosis / meditations (about 50 minutes)
    on the channel. In the middle, you’ll find longer pauses designed to help you
    sink more easily into sleep. At the end, there are empowering affirmations for
    strength and a restful sleep throughout the whole night. This hypnosis took a
    lot of work! If it helped you, please show your support by leaving a comment or

  description: "Video made by: Calm Horizon\n_________________________ \nStep into\
    \ a realm of tranquility and restoration, where the gentle cascade of water and\
    \ a soft purple glow merge to guide you into a state of deep, healing sleep. This\
    \ video is an invitation to drift away from the stress of everyday life and surrender\
    \ to an experience of profound hypnosis and rejuvenation. Here, the soothing sounds\
    \ of healing sleep music and the quiet murmur of cascading water help dissolve\
    \ subconscious negativity and pave the way for your inner healing.\nAt the heart\
    \ of this experience is a mesmerizing waterfall, lit by an ethereal purple light\
    \ that infuses the scene with mystery and peaceful energy. As you gaze upon the\
    \ waterfall, which gracefully tumbles into a calm, reflective pool, allow its\
    \ rhythmic flow to entrain your breath. The water’s natural cadence mirrors the\
    \ gentle rise and fall of your own heartbeat, reminding you that every moment\
    \ is an opportunity to reset and heal.\nThe surrounding forest, tall trees standing\
    \ as silent guardians, breathes life into the scene. Beneath a star-flecked sky,\
    \ these natural sentinels stand in quiet solidarity with your inner journey. They\
    \ symbolize growth, resilience, and the natural cycle of renewal—reminding you\
    \ that, just like nature, you too can transform and thrive even after periods\
    \ of darkness. The soft, radiant glow of the scene, paired with subtle twinkles\
    \ resembling fireflies or glowing orbs, instills a sense of wonder and magic that\
    \ calms the mind and encourages deep introspection.\nThis sleep hypnosis session\
    \ is meticulously designed to address and eliminate the mental blockages and negativity\
    \ that may have been holding you back. As the sleep music gently pulses around\
    \ you, it invites your subconscious to release long-held tensions. You are gently\
    \ coaxed into a meditative state, where each note and every whisper of sound is\
    \ a stepping stone to a healthier, more balanced mindset. The serene soundscape\
    \ synchronizes with your brainwaves, leading you into a realm where healing energy\
    \ flows freely and every breath becomes a balm for the soul.\nImagine, as you\
    \ lie back and relax, that you are being cradled by nature’s own lullaby. There\
    \ is no rush, no pressure—a slow, deliberate passage into sleep that lasts long\
    \ enough for your body to mend and your mind to recalibrate. In this sacred space,\
    \ you are safe to let go of all destructive thoughts and embrace the healing message\
    \ embedded within every chord and every ripple of water.\nAs you surrender to\
    \ this hypnotic journey, allow your worries to dissolve like mist as the natural\
    \ elements cleanse your emotional and mental landscapes. Trust in the process,\
    \ for with every deep breath, you are moving closer to a state of pure restorative\
    \ sleep—one where subconscious negativity is washed away, leaving room for clarity,\
    \ peace, and renewed inner strength.\nImmerse yourself in the serenity of this\
    \ nighttime oasis, a place where dreams are born and healing begins, and let the\
    \ hypnotic power of nature guide you to a restful, awakened state of well-being.\n\

  description: "Release stored trauma from the body without needing to recall or relive\
    \ the events associated with the stored emotions.  As your subconscious is connected\
    \ to all of you, all of your brain and all parts of the body, so your mind, with\
    \ the power of my words and in a state of hypnosis can find and release whatever\
    \ is trapped in the body.  \n\nThis session uses the theory of the body from hypnotherapy\
    \ which states that specific emotions are stored in key areas of the body.   For\
    \ example, anxiety is stored in the digestive system, anger and rage in the liver,\
    \ grief, sorrow and loss in the heart or lungs.  \n\nThroughout this session you\
    \ will be accompanied by your guardian or spirit guide who will protect you from\
    \ any vulnerability so that you can open up and peacefully release whatever is\
    \ a burden, heal deeper wounds.  Free yourself from the past now. \n\nTime Stamps\n\

  description: 'What’s been stuck in your gut… can now be released.

    This guided hypnosis session is a gentle, soul-led journey to support your nervous
    system, heal your gut-brain connection, and restore emotional balance. Whether
    you struggle with anxiety, stress eating, burnout, or simply feeling off, this
    experience invites your body, mind, and spirit to reset.


    You’ll begin by connecting with your soul’s voice… then learn how digestive health
    and mental well-being are intimately linked through the vagus nerve. Through guided
    visualization, you’ll release emotional weight stored in the body and remember
    the safety of stillness.

  description: "This guided meditation reprograms the new YOU! (Your shift begins\
    \ the moment you press play.)\n\nWhat if the version of you that’s been manifesting\
    \ your life… isn't the one that gets everything you want?  This guided meditation\
    \ hypnosis bypasses conscious thought and speaks directly to your subconscious—\
    \ reprogramming your mind to operate from a new, upgraded version of you and programming\
    \ your mind to manifest the timeline that reflects the life you were meant to\
    \ live.\n\n✨ Extended 8-hour version available in my store: https://www.jessicaconnorphd.com/product/unlock-your-new-life-shift-timelines-while-you-sleep-8-hour-extended-version/\n\
    \nYou’ll release the version of you shaped by fear, survival, and old programming—and\
    \ activate the one built for joy, freedom, abundance, and ease. Through layered\
    \ sound design, 432 Hz theta wave meditation music, and hypnotic affirmations,\
    \ this experience guides your subconscious mind to lock in a new signal for manifestation…\
    \ so the shift becomes AUTOMATIC. Once your subconscious mind receives this update,\
    \ your life begins to shift in return—because you're no longer manifesting from\
    \ the past. You're creating from a new version of YOU.\n\nThis session blends\
    \ guided hypnosis, subconscious mind reprogramming, and identity shifting into\
    \ one powerful experience so you can manifest love, manifest money, shift timelines,\
    \ or upgrade your self-concept (self-image) identity.  \n#hypnosis #guidedmeditation\

  description: "Hypnosis—stage act or science? Neil deGrasse Tyson, joined by co-hosts\
    \ Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly, dives into the mysterious world of hypnosis with\
    \ clinical psychiatrist David Spiegel. What is hypnosis? Is it about losing control—or\
    \ gaining it?\n\nWe explore the human mind and consciousness, asking if there’s\
    \ a “user manual” for our brains. How does hypnosis work? Dr. Spiegel explains\
    \ how our salience network, which processes external stimuli, can be “turned down,”\
    \ allowing us to engage deeply with our inner thoughts. Could this altered state\
    \ offer new perspectives on ourselves and our world?\n\nSome are more hypnotizable\
    \ than others—why? Is there a genetic component, or can external factors like\
    \ magnetic stimulation enhance hypnotizability? We discuss the science behind\
    \ these questions and how hypnosis differs from meditation. Think of meditation\
    \ as a vitamin and hypnosis as an antibiotic—targeted and potent, especially for\
    \ managing pain and breaking bad habits. Could hypnosis be used for evil as well\
    \ as for good? \n\nFrom recovering memories to treating phantom limb pain, hypnosis\
    \ reveals its potential—and limitations. Dr. Spiegel shares the risks of implanted\
    \ memories and debunks myths about control and resistance. We explore real-world\
    \ applications like overcoming phobias and addictions as well as enhancing athletic\
    \ performance. Plus, we discuss the potential for self-hypnosis to revolutionize\
    \ medicine. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: David Spiegel\n03:15 - What\
    \ is Hypnosis? \n06:55 - Is Everyone Hypnotizable? \n12:33 - The Default Mode\

  description: 'Welcome to this Deep Sleep Hypnosis, Guided Sleep Meditation. This
    session is designed to help you fall asleep faster, sleep more deeply, and wake
    up feeling restored. This version includes gentle pink noise layered in the background
    to deepen relaxation and support restful sleep.


    We’ll begin by soothing the body with gentle breathwork, gradually releasing tension
    as you drift deeper into stillness. We’ll then use affirmations and hypnotic cues
    to reinforce a deep sense of peace—helping you let go of stress and surrender
    to effortless rest.


    This extended 8-hour sleep hypnosis is especially helpful if you’re feeling depleted,
    burnt out, or mentally exhausted. As you listen, your subconscious mind will absorb
    every suggestion for calm, renewal, and deep restoration—supporting you as your
    body and mind recharge overnight. The affirmations will continue softly in the
    background and gradually grow quieter and quieter over time, allowing your mind
    to drift even deeper into uninterrupted rest.


    For best results, listen for seven nights in a row. Let go, unwind, and experience
    deep, rejuvenating sleep.


    💤 Press play and let your deepest rest begin.

    \ if you understand astral travel and you’re ready to master dream control, quantum\
    \ jump to a parallel reality, and manifest fast during an out of body experience.\n\
    \n\U0001F534Subscribe: @YourYouniverse \n\U0001F534MY LINKS ➡️ https://linktr.ee/YourYouniverse\n\
    \nThis hypnosis session will TRANSPORT you into a deep, lucid dreamscape where\
    \ manifestation becomes EFFORTLESS. Guided by Jessica Connor, Ph.D., this powerful\
    \ lucid dreaming meditation has been carefully designed for parallel reality shifting,\
    \ dream mastery, and quantum jumping into a reality you prefer. \n\n\U0001F534\
    To purchase the 8-hour \"Deep Dreaming\" extended version of this meditation:\
    \ https://www.jessicaconnorphd.com/product/lucid-dreaming-quantum-jumping-hypnosis-8-hour-deep-dreaming-extended-sleep-version-w-subliminal-affirmations-theta-waves/\n\
    \nWhen you listen to this guided meditation, you’ll go through a limitless exploration\
    \ within the realm of your subconscious mind and experience an out of body journey\
    \ in the astral plane that aligns you with your chosen reality... manifesting\
    \ it as vivid, tangible, and ALREADY yours.\n\nAfter the guided lucid dreaming\
    \ hypnosis (approximately 1-hour), you will be given an affirmation loop with\
    \ strong hypnotic suggestions to enhance your lucid dreaming mastery, as well\
    \ as your manifestation skillset. The volume will dip during the affirmations\
    \ to an easy listening level (after the screen goes black).\n\n\U0001F534My Quantum\
    \ Jumping Theta Hypnosis Bundle ➡️ https://bit.ly/quantum-jumping-theta-hypnosis\n\
    \U0001F534My Quantum Manifestation Theta Meditation and Hypnosis Bundle ➡️ https://bit.ly/quantum-manifestation-bundle\n\
    \nThis unique hypnosis session incorporates advanced neuro-editing and dual induction\
    \ technology to stimulate various brain areas, amplifying the impact on your subconscious\
    \ mind. \n\nThe accompanying theta wave track and immersive sound effects will\
    \ deepen your trance state and enhance your receptivity. These audio features\
    \ are designed to ensure a profound out-of-body experience and facilitate a direct\
    \ connection with deeper, quantum realms.\n\nAs you engage with the session, you’ll\
    \ explore the potential of lucid dreaming to shift your reality, manifest desires,\
    \ and quantum jump to parallel realities, all within the safety and comfort of\
    \ your dream world. \n\nLearn to master manifestation... a perfect blend for those\
    \ interested in the law of attraction and quantum leaps.\n\n\U0001F534 SUPPORT\

    For best results, commit to listening for at least 30 days, though 60-90 days\
    \ is recommended for deeper transformative effects. This session is also ideal\
    \ for anyone looking to improve sleep or explore deeper meditation states. \n\n\
    This guided hypnosis is also perfect for those interested in astral projection,\
    \ quantum jumping to a parallel reality, as well as individuals exploring manifestation\
    \ techniques and “how to manifest anything you desire”, or those seeking relaxation\
    \ through ASMR hypnosis or sleep meditation.\n\n\U0001F3A7 Listening Tips for\
    \ Effective Dream Control and Manifestation:\n\nUse headphones to fully experience\
    \ the binaural and light ASMR effects.\nChoose a quiet, undisturbed space to ensure\
    \ deep relaxation and effective meditation.\nDo not listen while driving or operating\
    \ heavy machinery to maintain safety during deep meditation.\n\nMusical Track:\
    \ \"Ascend\" by Christopher Lloyd Clarke. http://www.christopherlloydclarke.com\n\
