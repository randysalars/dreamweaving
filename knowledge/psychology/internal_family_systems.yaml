# INTERNAL FAMILY SYSTEMS (IFS) - Parts Work for Dreamweaving
# =============================================================================
# IFS provides a framework for understanding the psyche as a system of
# sub-personalities or "parts." This approach offers powerful tools for
# healing, integration, and self-understanding within hypnotic journeys.
#
# Usage: Apply IFS concepts for inner dialogue, healing wounded parts,
#        and integrating conflicting aspects of self.

overview:
  name: "Internal Family Systems (IFS)"
  founder: "Richard C. Schwartz, PhD"
  origin: "1980s-1990s"

  definition:
    brief: "A therapeutic model that views the psyche as a system of protective and wounded sub-personalities or 'parts'"
    extended: |
      Internal Family Systems (IFS) is an evidence-based psychotherapy model
      that understands the mind as naturally multiple - composed of many
      sub-personalities or "parts" that interact like members of a family.
      These parts take on different roles: some protect (Managers, Firefighters),
      some carry pain (Exiles). Beneath all parts is the Self - a core of
      calm, compassion, and clarity that can heal and lead the internal system.

      IFS assumes:
      - All parts have good intentions (even destructive ones)
      - Parts are not to be eliminated but befriended and healed
      - The Self can lead the system with compassion
      - Healing happens through relationship, not force

  core_concepts:
    - "The psyche is naturally multiple, composed of parts"
    - "All parts have positive intentions, even if behaviors are destructive"
    - "Parts can be wounded and carry 'burdens' from the past"
    - "The Self is the core essence - calm, compassionate, connected"
    - "Healing happens when Self witnesses and unbinds parts"

  relevance_to_dreamweaving: |
    IFS provides:
    - Framework for inner dialogue journeys
    - Method for meeting and healing wounded aspects
    - Structure for integration work
    - Non-pathologizing approach to inner conflict
    - Clear process for transformation

# THE SELF

  name: "The Self"

  definition:
    brief: "The core essence of a person - calm, compassionate, curious, and connected"
    extended: |
      In IFS, the Self is not a part but the essential core of every person.
      When parts relax and step back, the Self naturally emerges. The Self
      has inherent qualities of compassion, clarity, curiosity, creativity,
      courage, calmness, connectedness, and confidence. The Self can witness
      parts without becoming them, and can heal them through relationship.

  qualities:
    the_eight_cs:
      - calm: "Centered, peaceful, not reactive"
      - compassion: "Caring presence for all parts"
      - curiosity: "Open interest in parts without judgment"
      - clarity: "Clear seeing, not confused"
      - courage: "Willing to face difficult material"
      - creativity: "Spontaneous, resourceful responses"
      - connectedness: "Sense of connection to all things"
      - confidence: "Trust in the process and in Self"

  experience:
    physical: "Open chest, relaxed body, present"
    emotional: "Calm, loving, interested"
    mental: "Clear, spacious, non-judgmental"

    name: "Managers"

    definition:
      brief: "Protective parts that try to prevent pain by controlling life"
      extended: |
        Managers are proactive protective parts that try to keep the person
        safe by controlling their life, relationships, and behavior. They
        work to prevent exiled feelings from emerging by maintaining order,
        achievement, perfectionism, people-pleasing, or other controlling
        strategies.

    name: "Firefighters"

    definition:
      brief: "Reactive protective parts that put out emotional fires when pain breaks through"
      extended: |
        Firefighters are reactive protective parts that spring into action
        when exile pain threatens to overwhelm the system. They use urgent,
        often destructive behaviors to distract from or numb the pain -
        including addictions, dissociation, rage, self-harm, or other
        extreme measures. They are emergency responders, not calculated
        planners.

    common_types:
      - name: "The Addict"
        behavior: "Uses substances/behaviors to numb pain"
        fear: "Being overwhelmed by feelings"

      - name: "The Rager"
        behavior: "Explodes with anger to push away vulnerability"
        fear: "Being hurt, powerless"

      - name: "The Dissociator"
        behavior: "Checks out, spaces out, leaves body"
        fear: "Present-moment pain"

      - name: "The Self-Harmer"
        behavior: "Uses physical pain to distract from emotional"
        fear: "Unbearable emotional pain"

      - name: "The Binger"
        behavior: "Overconsumes food, media, shopping"
        fear: "Emptiness, pain"

    positive_intent: |
      Firefighters are desperately trying to protect from overwhelming pain.
      Their methods may be destructive, but their intention is survival.
      They need compassion, not condemnation.

  exiles:

    name: "Exiles"

    definition:
      brief: "Wounded parts carrying pain from the past, kept hidden by protectors"
      extended: |
        Exiles are young parts of us that were overwhelmed by painful
        experiences and carry the "burdens" of those experiences - beliefs
        like "I'm worthless," feelings like terror or shame, sensations
        frozen in the body. They are locked away by protectors because
        their pain is seen as dangerous to the system. They desperately
        want to be seen, heard, and healed.

    common_burdens:
      beliefs:
        - "I am worthless"
        - "I am unlovable"
        - "I am bad"
        - "I am alone"
        - "The world is dangerous"
        - "I have to be perfect to be loved"

      feelings:
        - "Shame"
        - "Terror"
        - "Grief"
        - "Abandonment"
        - "Helplessness"
        - "Despair"

    characteristics:
      - "Often appear as younger versions of self"
      - "Carry intense emotions frozen in time"
      - "Want to be witnessed and healed"
      - "Hold memories protectors avoid"

    positive_intent: |
      Exiles don't want to harm - they want to be healed.
      They carry the pain so the rest of the system can function.
      They are frozen in time, waiting for rescue.
