# POLYVAGAL THEORY - Autonomic States and Safety for Hypnotic Work
# =============================================================================
# Stephen Porges' polyvagal theory provides the neurobiological foundation
# for safe, effective hypnotic work. Understanding autonomic states enables
# precise regulation of listener states for optimal transformation.
#
# Usage: Apply vagal activation patterns for safety; recognize state shifts.
#        Use cues to facilitate ventral vagal engagement.

# OVERVIEW

overview:
  name: "Polyvagal Theory"
  source: "Stephen Porges - The Polyvagal Theory (2011)"

  definition:
    brief: "Theory of the hierarchical autonomic nervous system and its role in safety, connection, and survival"
    extended: |
      Polyvagal theory describes three evolutionary stages of the autonomic
      nervous system that mediate our responses to safety and threat.
      The ventral vagal system enables social engagement and feelings of
      safety; the sympathetic system mobilizes fight/flight; the dorsal
      vagal system immobilizes (freeze/shutdown). Effective hypnotic work
      requires establishing ventral vagal safety before deep exploration.
    essence: "Safety is the foundation of all healing"

  three_circuits:
    ventral_vagal:
      name: "Social Engagement System"
      function: "Safety, connection, calm presence"
      evolutionary: "Most recent (mammals)"
    sympathetic:
      name: "Mobilization System"
      function: "Fight, flight, action"
      evolutionary: "Middle (vertebrates)"
    dorsal_vagal:
      name: "Immobilization System"
      function: "Freeze, shutdown, conservation"
      evolutionary: "Oldest (reptilian)"

  dreamweaving_relevance: |
    Polyvagal theory explains why safety must precede depth in hypnotic work.
    The ventral vagal state enables the receptivity required for transformation.
    Sympathetic activation blocks trance; dorsal collapse is dangerous.
    All vagal_activation patterns in hypnotic_patterns.yaml work by
    engaging the ventral vagal system.

# =============================================================================
# VENTRAL VAGAL STATE
# =============================================================================

ventral_vagal:
  entry_id: "psychology.polyvagal.ventral_vagal"
  name: "Ventral Vagal State (Social Engagement)"
  circuit: "ventral_vagal"

  definition:
    brief: "State of safety, calm, and social connection mediated by the myelinated vagus"
    extended: |
      The ventral vagal state is our optimal state for healing and growth.
      When we feel safe, the ventral vagal complex allows for calm alertness,
      social engagement, and openness to experience. Heart rate is regulated,
      breathing is smooth, facial muscles are relaxed, voice is melodic.
      This state is necessary for hypnotic receptivity.

  attributes:
    energy_quality: balanced
    brainwave: alpha
    heart_rate: "60-80 bpm, high HRV"
    breathing: "Slow, diaphragmatic, 5-7 breaths/min"
    muscle_tone: "Relaxed but not collapsed"

  physiological_markers:
    - Heart rate variability high
    - Slow, regular breathing
    - Relaxed facial muscles
    - Soft eye gaze
    - Musical prosody in voice
    - Ability to listen and respond
    - Presence and engagement

  psychological_experience:
    - Feeling safe
    - Open and curious
    - Connected to self and environment
    - Calm but alert
    - Receptive to new information
    - Able to reflect

  applications:
    journey_phases: [pre_talk, induction, integration, reorientation]
    outcome_alignment: [all_outcomes]
    use_cases:
      - "Establishing baseline safety"
      - "Creating rapport and trust"
      - "Integration and return"
      - "Anchoring resources"

  cues_to_activate:
    vocal:
      - Warm, melodic voice tone
      - Slow, rhythmic speech
      - Gentle prosody variations
      - Soft landing at phrase ends
    environmental:
      - Consistent, predictable soundscape
      - Gentle background sounds
      - No sudden changes
      - Warm, soft tones
    somatic:
      - Orienting to safety ("You are safe here")
      - Grounding language ("Feel the support beneath you")
      - Breath awareness (slow exhale emphasis)
      - Facial relaxation cues

# =============================================================================
# SYMPATHETIC STATE
# =============================================================================

sympathetic:
  entry_id: "psychology.polyvagal.sympathetic"
  name: "Sympathetic State (Fight/Flight)"
  circuit: "sympathetic"

  definition:
    brief: "State of mobilization for action - fight, flight, or effortful activity"
    extended: |
      The sympathetic state prepares the body for action in response to
      perceived threat or challenge. Heart rate increases, breathing
      becomes rapid and shallow, muscles tense for action. While
      necessary for survival, sustained sympathetic activation blocks
      hypnotic receptivity and prevents healing.

  attributes:
    energy_quality: active
    brainwave: beta
    heart_rate: "80-120+ bpm, low HRV"
    breathing: "Rapid, shallow, chest-dominant"
    muscle_tone: "Tense, ready for action"

  physiological_markers:
    - Elevated heart rate
    - Rapid, shallow breathing
    - Muscle tension (jaw, shoulders, belly)
    - Wide, scanning eyes
    - Restlessness, fidgeting
    - Racing thoughts

  psychological_experience:
    - Anxiety or agitation
    - Hypervigilance
    - Difficulty settling
    - Racing thoughts
    - Urge to escape or act
    - Difficulty receiving

  in_hypnotic_work:
    recognition: |
      Listener may report feeling anxious, restless, or unable to relax.
      May have racing thoughts or physical tension. This state must be
      regulated before proceeding with deeper work.
    response: |
      - Slow voice pace
      - Extend exhales
      - Grounding imagery
      - Permission language
      - Do NOT proceed to deep trance

# DORSAL VAGAL STATE
# =============================================================================

dorsal_vagal:
  entry_id: "psychology.polyvagal.dorsal_vagal"
  name: "Dorsal Vagal State (Freeze/Shutdown)"
  circuit: "dorsal_vagal"

  definition:
    brief: "State of immobilization - freeze, shutdown, or collapse"
    extended: |
      The dorsal vagal state is the oldest survival response, involving
      immobilization and conservation of resources. It manifests as
      numbness, dissociation, or collapse. While sometimes protective,
      this state is not therapeutic and can be dangerous in hypnotic
      work if it represents dissociation.

  attributes:
    energy_quality: collapsed
    brainwave: "delta (non-therapeutic)"
    heart_rate: "Below 60 bpm, very low HRV"
    breathing: "Shallow, minimal"
    muscle_tone: "Flaccid, collapsed"

  physiological_markers:
    - Very slow heart rate
    - Shallow, minimal breathing
    - Muscle collapse
    - Flat affect
    - Glazed eyes
    - Pale color
    - Numbness

  psychological_experience:
    - Numbness, disconnection
    - Dissociation
    - Hopelessness
    - Inability to respond
    - Feeling frozen or stuck
    - Checked out sensation

  in_hypnotic_work:
    recognition: |
      Listener becomes unresponsive, may appear "too relaxed," or reports
      feeling numb, disconnected, or "gone." This is NOT therapeutic
      depth - it is a protective shutdown that must be addressed.
    response: |
      - Gentle physical activation cues
      - Increase voice energy slightly
      - Grounding to sensation
      - Movement suggestions (wiggle fingers/toes)
      - Orient to present environment
      - Do NOT proceed deeper

  contraindications:
    - Never mistake dorsal shutdown for deep trance
    - Dissociative clients may easily shift to dorsal
    - Always maintain gentle engagement
    - Return to ventral before continuing

    ssml_gentle_activation: |
      <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
      And now...<break time="1.5s"/>

    - Orienting to sensation
    - Slightly increased voice energy
    - Movement cues (small, peripheral)
    - Environmental grounding
    - Eye contact cues (if in person)

state_transitions:

  ventral_to_sympathetic:
    trigger: "Perceived threat, overwhelm, moving too fast"
    signs: "Increased tension, faster breathing, restlessness"
    response: "Slow down, ground, reassure safety"

  sympathetic_to_dorsal:
    trigger: "Overwhelm exceeds capacity, helplessness"
    signs: "Sudden stillness, numbness, disconnection"
    response: "Gentle activation, orient to present, do not continue"

  dorsal_to_sympathetic:
    trigger: "Beginning to mobilize out of freeze"
    signs: "Agitation, anger, trembling as energy returns"
    response: "Allow discharge, support movement, then ground"

  sympathetic_to_ventral:
    trigger: "Successful regulation, safety established"
    signs: "Slowing breath, relaxing muscles, settling"
    response: "Reinforce safety, proceed gently"

  dorsal_to_ventral:
    trigger: "Must pass through sympathetic - pendulation"
    signs: "Gradual return of feeling, engagement"
    response: "Very gentle, allow organic return, do not rush"

  extended_exhale:
    entry_id: "psychology.polyvagal.techniques.extended_exhale"
    name: "Extended Exhale Breathing"
    type: "breath"

    mechanism: |
      Long exhales activate the vagal brake, stimulating parasympathetic
      response. The 4-7-8 or similar patterns ensure exhale dominance.

    template: |
      <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
      And now...<break time="1.5s"/>
      take a gentle breath in...<break time="3s"/>

  humming_toning:
    entry_id: "psychology.polyvagal.techniques.humming"
    name: "Humming / Vocal Toning"
    type: "vocal"

    mechanism: |
      Vocalization stimulates the vagus nerve through laryngeal muscles.
      Humming creates vibration that directly activates vagal pathways.

    template: |
      <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
      And if it feels right...<break time="2s"/>
      you might let a gentle humming sound arise...<break time="2s"/>

  jaw_release:
    entry_id: "psychology.polyvagal.techniques.jaw_release"
    name: "Jaw and Facial Release"
    type: "physical"

    mechanism: |
      Facial muscles connect to the vagal system. Releasing jaw tension
      signals safety to the nervous system.

    template: |
      <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
      And you can let your jaw soften...<break time="2s"/>

  swallow_deepener:
    entry_id: "psychology.polyvagal.techniques.swallow"
    name: "Swallow Deepener"
    type: "physical"

    mechanism: |
      Swallowing activates the vagus nerve directly. Gentle swallowing
      cues deepen relaxation and signal safety.

    name: "Orienting to Safety"
    type: "orientation"

    mechanism: |
      Orienting to the environment and confirming safety activates
      the social engagement system. The nervous system relaxes when
      it has checked for and found no threat.
