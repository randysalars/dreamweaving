# Abundance Mindset Knowledge Base
# Comprehensive framework for prosperity consciousness through Dreamweaving

  description: |
    Complete abundance mindset framework integrating transpersonal psychology,
    subconscious reprogramming, archetypal prosperity symbols, quantum field
    metaphors, and advanced identity transformation techniques. Provides
    Dreamweaving templates for cultivating wealth consciousness at all levels.

  core_insight: |
    An abundance mindset is not built through willpower. It is built through
    identity reconstruction at subconscious depth. You cannot install abundance
    on top of scarcity wounds. The subconscious only accepts abundance when it
    feels safe—and when the identity has been rebuilt to hold it.

    You cannot install abundance on top of scarcity wounds.
    The old programming must be dissolved before new patterns can take root.

      method: |
        Guide the viewer down a staircase into the subconscious archives.
        Show them a "hall of old stories" where scarcity thoughts appear
        as brittle, fading structures. Have them release, burn, or transform
        these artifacts.

        The subconscious only accepts abundance when it feels safe.
        Use subtle binaural patterns + breath cues that signal safety
        to release stored scarcity tension from the body.

  principle: |
    Symbols bypass logic and speak directly to the subconscious.
    When used repeatedly across Dreamweavings, they become internal
    "codes" that trigger abundance states automatically.

    spirals:
      meaning: "Infinite expansion, growth without limit"
      use: "Visualize spiraling outward during expansion sequences"

    flowing_water:
      meaning: "Unstoppable flow, finding the path of least resistance"
      use: "Represent money and opportunity as flowing streams"

    expanding_circles:
      meaning: "Rippling influence, growing reach"
      use: "Show impact and abundance radiating outward"

    radiant_light:
      meaning: "Source energy, illumination, attraction"

  name: "Self-Worth and Deservingness Rewiring"

  principle: |
    Abundance aligns with identity and worthiness, not logic.
    You never outperform your self-image. You always return to
    the identity your subconscious believes is true.

  core_wounds:
    not_enough:
      belief: "I am not enough as I am"

      healing: "Your prosperity benefits everyone"

    others_first:
      belief: "Others deserve it more than me"
      healing: "There is enough for everyone; your portion awaits"

    method: |
      Use narrative hypnosis to bring them face-to-face with their "Abundant Self."
      Their future self radiates confidence, shows them what life looks like when
      abundance is normal, passes them an "energetic gift"—often a glowing emblem
      or sigil. The viewer receives the feeling of abundance as a direct transmission.
      This bypasses the critical mind entirely.

energetic_frameworks:
  entry_id: "psychology.abundance.energetic"
  name: "Quantum and Energetic Abundance Technologies"

  note: |
    These are metaphorical and psychological frameworks, not literal physics.
    They work through emotional coherence, symbolic resonance, and identity shift.

  heart_coherence:
    entry_id: "psychology.abundance.energetic.heart"
    name: "Heart Coherence for Receiving"

    principle: |
      An abundant mindset requires alignment between thought → emotion → energy.
      Heart coherence creates a state where intention becomes energetically "sticky."
      The heart's electromagnetic field broadcasts intentions into the environment.

    coherence_induction:
      - "Slow rhythmic breathing"
      - "Focus attention on heart center"
      - "Generate feelings of gratitude"

    principle: |
      Instead of seeking abundance, create an internal gravitational field for it.
      Like attractors in complexity theory, you become a mass that abundance orbits.

    method: |
      Create a psychoenergetic "vortex" that spins around the heart or solar plexus,
      pulling in opportunities, ideas, people. The viewer doesn't think abundance—
      they become a mass that abundance orbits.

    imagery:

    principle: |
      More advanced than standard visualization. Make the viewer feel as though
      the future where they are abundant has already happened—and they are

      An egregore is a thought-form or psychic pattern that gains power through
      attention. Dreamweaving can give form to an Abundance Egregore, connect
