      brief: "Using dreamweaving to activate the default mode network for subconscious problem-solving and 'aha!' moment generation"
      extended: |
        Dreamweavings activate the default mode network (DMN), which excels at:
        - Reorganizing ideas across disparate domains
        - Connecting distant concepts through associative pathways
        - Generating insights that structured analytical thinking misses
        - Processing problems during apparent "mental rest"

        This is the same mechanism behind:
        - Hypnagogic breakthroughs (Edison, Dali techniques)
        - Creative flow states
        - "Aha!" moments and sudden insight
        - Dream-based problem solving

        Use dreamweavings to deliberately incubate problems by:
        1. Loading the problem into symbolic form
        2. Releasing attachment to solving it
        3. Allowing subconscious processing during journey
        4. Receiving insight packages upon return

        The subconscious mind can process problems while the conscious mind
        is engaged in symbolic exploration, returning solutions that feel
        like gifts rather than effortful conclusions.

    domain: "psychology"
    category: "cognition"

    definition:
      brief: "Using symbols to compress vast meaning into simple forms, enabling faster thinking and deeper pattern recognition"
      extended: |
        Symbols compress vast meaning into simple forms. A dreamweaving
        filled with archetypes acts like a symbol processor, letting you
        metabolize ideas faster than verbal-linear thinking allows.

        Core compression symbols:
        - Mountain = long-term goals, challenges overcome
        - Forge = transformation, refinement, creation
        - River = emotional processing, flow, change
        - Star = intuitive guidance, aspiration, light in darkness
        - Tree = growth, rootedness, branching possibilities
        - Bridge = connection, transition, crossing thresholds
        - Key = solutions, access, unlocking potential
        - Mirror = self-reflection, truth, seeing clearly

        This gives the mind a visual-semantic compression system that:
        - Improves recall through vivid imagery
        - Enhances reasoning through symbolic manipulation
        - Accelerates decision-making through pattern matching
        - Creates reusable mental shortcuts (cognitive artifacts)

        Over time, your internal symbol library becomes a high-bandwidth
        language for thought itself.

    domain: "psychology"
    category: "cognition"

    definition:
      brief: "Using dreamweaving to sculpt predictions, refine mental models of reality, and train the brain's internal operating system"
      extended: |
        The brain constantly predicts the world and updates its models
        based on prediction errors (Active Inference / Predictive Processing).
        Dreamweavings allow you to:

        1. SCULPT PREDICTIONS
           - Visualize desired outcomes with sensory richness
           - Train the brain to expect positive patterns
           - Reduce negative prediction bias

        2. REFINE REALITY MODELS
           - Identify faulty assumptions symbolically
           - Replace inaccurate models with upgraded versions
           - Test new interpretations in imaginal space

        3. REMOVE FAULTY BELIEFS
           - Surface limiting beliefs as symbolic forms
           - Transform or dissolve them in the journey
           - Install reality-aligned replacements

        4. INSTALL UPGRADED INTERPRETATIONS
           - Encode new ways of seeing situations
           - Practice flexible perspective-taking
           - Build repertoire of useful mental models

        In essence, dreamweavings train your internal operating system
        to think more clearly, accurately, and adaptively.

  dual_process_synchronizer:

    name: "Dual-Process Synchronizer"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "cognition"

    definition:
      brief: "Techniques for synchronizing analytical (System 2) and intuitive (System 1) thinking into integrated whole-brain cognition"
      extended: |
        Dual-Process Theory describes two modes of thinking:
        - System 1: Fast, intuitive, automatic, pattern-matching
        - System 2: Slow, analytical, deliberate, logical

        Most people use these separately, creating:
        - Intuitive leaps without logical verification
        - Analytical paralysis without intuitive insight
        - Conflict between "head" and "gut"

        The Dual-Process Synchronizer trains:

        1. MEETING THE TWO GUIDES
           - The Analyst: precise, logical, systematic
           - The Oracle: intuitive, pattern-sensing, holistic
           - They appear as distinct presences in the journey

        2. MERGING ENERGIES
           - The guides combine into an integrated presence
           - Neither dominates; both contribute
           - Creates a "third" mode of unified cognition

        3. INTEGRATED QUESTIONING
           - Problems are presented to the merged presence
           - Answers combine logical structure with intuitive insight
           - Both "feel right" and "make sense"

        4. PRACTICE WHOLE-BRAIN THINKING
           - Repeated training builds new neural pathways
           - Integration becomes automatic over time
           - Access both systems simultaneously in waking life

        This creates whole-brain thinking where analysis and intuition
        work as partners rather than competitors.

    domain: "psychology"
    category: "cognition"

    definition:
      brief: "A structured technique for solving problems using coordinated conscious and subconscious processing"
      extended: |
        The Insight Bridge Method creates a visible symbolic structure for
        shuttling problems between conscious and subconscious processing.

        THE INSIGHT BRIDGE PROTOCOL:

        1. ENTER A CALM LANDSCAPE
           - Establish relaxed, receptive state
           - Ground in embodied awareness

        2. SEE THE GLOWING BRIDGE
           - A luminous bridge appears, connecting:
             - Near side: conscious awareness
             - Far side: deep subconscious/unknown

        3. LOAD THE PROBLEM
           - Place your problem or question into a floating sphere
           - Hold it without trying to solve it

        4. RELEASE ACROSS THE BRIDGE
           - Let the sphere drift across the bridge
           - Watch it disappear into the subconscious mists
           - Release all effort to solve

        5. RECEIVE INSIGHT PACKAGES
           - Notice what drifts back across the bridge
           - Symbols, images, feelings, phrases
           - Accept without immediate interpretation

        6. INTEGRATE UPON RETURN
           - Bring the packages back to waking awareness
           - Interpret and apply the insights
           - Trust the process even if meaning isn't immediate

        This trains the brain in conscious-subconscious collaboration,
        creating reliable insight-generation loops.

      extended: |
        The Cognitive Reframing Chamber uses the mirror as a transformation
        tool, allowing direct visualization and modification of thought patterns.

        THE REFRAMING CHAMBER PROTOCOL:

        1. ENTER THE CHAMBER OF MIRRORS
           - A circular room with shifting mirrors on all walls
           - Each mirror shows a different aspect of thought

        2. IDENTIFY DISTORTED PATTERNS
           - One mirror shows a recurring thought pattern
           - See it clearly: catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking,
             should statements, mind reading, etc.
           - The distortion is visible as warping in the mirror

        3. CALL THE GUIDE
           - A wise guide appears who can "rewrite" reflections
           - They understand both your intent and higher truth

        4. TRANSFORM THE REFLECTION
           - The guide adjusts the mirror
           - The warped thought straightens into an empowered version
           - Same situation, new interpretation
           - The old pattern dissolves; the new installs

        5. ANCHOR THE UPGRADE
           - Step through the mirror into the new pattern
           - Embody the upgraded thought form
           - Feel it as your new default

        6. REPEAT FOR MULTIPLE PATTERNS
           - Move to other mirrors as needed
           - Build a library of upgraded thought patterns

        This uses hypnotic reframing combined with symbolic restructuring
        for deep cognitive change.

        2. CONNECTIONS = VINE-BRIDGES
           - Related concepts connect via vines
           - Cross-domain insights = bridges between garden sections
           - The more connections, the stronger the network

        3. GARDENING ACTIONS
           - Planting: introducing new knowledge
           - Watering: attention, practice, review
           - Pruning: removing confusion, outdated info
           - Fertilizing: adding context, examples, applications
           - Harvesting: utilizing knowledge for creation

        4. GARDEN ZONES
           - Different areas for different domains
           - Central tree = core identity/expertise
           - Edge areas = new explorations

        The brain encodes these metaphors as schemas (mental models),
        making abstract learning processes concrete and manipulable.
        Regular visits to the garden reinforce neural pathways.

      brief: "A symbolic executive function training space for processing life input with clarity, speed, and accuracy"
      extended: |
        The Information Sorting Temple trains the brain's executive functions
        through symbolic practice, improving how you process the constant
        stream of life information.

        THE TEMPLE STRUCTURE:

        1. ENTER THE SORTING HALL
           - A grand hall with five glowing alcoves
           - Scrolls/packages fly toward you representing recent information

        2. THE FIVE ALCOVES (GTD-inspired)
           - KNOWLEDGE: Things to learn/remember
           - ACTION: Things requiring immediate doing
           - DELEGATION: Things others should handle
           - REFLECTION: Things requiring deeper thought
           - REMOVAL: Things to release/ignore

        3. SORTING PRACTICE
           - Each scroll presents itself
           - You sense its nature
           - You direct it to the appropriate alcove
           - The sorting becomes faster with practice

        4. INTEGRATION WISDOM
           - A guardian at each alcove offers insight:
             - Knowledge Guardian: "What does this teach?"
             - Action Guardian: "What is the next step?"
             - Delegation Guardian: "Who can help?"
             - Reflection Guardian: "What deeper meaning?"
             - Removal Guardian: "Can you let this go?"

        5. CLEARING THE QUEUE
           - Process until the hall is clear
           - Feel the clarity of a sorted mind

        This is symbolic executive function training that improves
        real-world information processing.

    name: "Problem Dissolution Vortex"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "cognition"

    definition:
      brief: "A hypnotic cognitive purifier that decomposes problems into symbolic fragments, leaving only core truth and insight"
      extended: |
        The Problem Dissolution Vortex is more powerful than normal reframing -
        it's symbolic cognitive alchemy that dissolves problems entirely,
        leaving only essential insight.

        THE VORTEX PROTOCOL:

        1. MANIFESTATION
           - A swirling black-violet vortex appears
           - It hums with transformative energy
           - It dissolves what is unnecessary, preserves what is true

        2. LOADING THE PROBLEM
           - Place the problem or mental block into the vortex
           - Watch it begin to spin and fragment

        3. DECOMPOSITION
           - The vortex separates:
             - Emotional charge (dissolved)
             - False assumptions (dissolved)
             - Limiting interpretations (dissolved)
             - Cognitive distortions (dissolved)
             - Core truth (preserved, purified)

        4. TRUTH EXTRACTION
           - Only the pure essence of insight remains
           - It emerges from the vortex as a glowing seed or gem
           - Undistorted, clear, actionable

        5. INTEGRATION
           - Receive the purified insight
           - Install it into your understanding
           - The problem has been transmuted into wisdom

        This technique eliminates mental noise to reveal the signal,
        producing insight that feels obvious once seen.

    definition:
      brief: "A technique for taking raw confused thoughts and manually reforging them into powerful, optimized cognitive artifacts"
      extended: |
        The Thought-Form Alchemist teaches active thought engineering -
        taking raw cognitive material and manually shaping it into useful tools.

        THE ALCHEMIST PROTOCOL:

        1. ENTER THE COSMIC FORGE
           - A massive anvil of light
           - A furnace of white-gold fire
           - Tools of precision and power

        2. IDENTIFY RAW MATERIAL
           - Confused thought = molten, unformed metal
           - Vague idea = rough ore
           - Recurring worry = corroded fragment

        3. HEATING AND PURIFICATION
           - Place the thought-material in the furnace
           - Heat burns away impurities
           - What remains is workable essence

        4. FORGING
           - Hammer the material into clear shape
           - Each strike adds:
             - Clarity (precise meaning)
             - Simplicity (essential form)
             - Utility (practical application)
             - Beauty (elegant expression)

        5. TEMPERING
           - Cool the new thought-form in sacred water
           - It hardens into stable shape
           - Test its edge and strength

        6. INSTALLATION
           - The forged thought becomes a cognitive artifact
           - A reusable mental tool
           - Invoke it whenever that type of thinking is needed

        Each reforged thought becomes a permanent cognitive upgrade.

  hyperdimensional_theater:
    entry_id: "psychology.cognition.hyperdimensional_theater"
    name: "Hyperdimensional Problem Theater"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "cognition"

    definition:
      brief: "A simulation space for running multiple parallel timelines and scenarios beyond normal linear thinking capacity"
      extended: |
        The Hyperdimensional Problem Theater allows simulation and pattern-testing
        at levels impossible for normal sequential thought.

        THEATER STRUCTURE:

        1. ENTER THE THEATER OF WORLDS
           - Huge dark space
           - Central floating "stage" of light
           - Above and around: countless potential scenes/worlds

        2. LOAD A PROBLEM SPACE
           - The problem appears as a world on the stage
           - Business plan, relationship, creative project, life choice
           - Full sensory detail and complexity

        3. FORKING TIMELINES
           - The world splits into parallel versions:
             - "If I choose A..." (timeline plays out)
             - "If I choose B..." (timeline plays out)
             - "If I delay..." (timeline plays out)
             - "If I change the core assumption..." (timeline plays out)
           - Watch multiple futures simultaneously

        4. PATTERN EXTRACTION
           - Genius Core pauses the theater
           - Time freezes across all timelines
           - It highlights:
             - Repeating patterns
             - "Strange attractors"
             - Key leverage points
             - Second and third-order effects

        5. PRINCIPLE DISTILLATION
           - From the pattern analysis, extract:
             - Core principles
             - Decision heuristics
             - Risk indicators
             - Opportunity signals

        6. REALITY MODEL UPGRADE
           - Bring the distilled principles back
           - Your brain becomes excellent at anticipating consequences

        This operates like an imaginal scenario planning laboratory.

      extended: |
        The Identity-Code Forge goes beyond changing thoughts to upgrading
        the entity that produces them - rewriting cognitive identity at the
        source level.

        FORGE STRUCTURE:

        1. ENTER THE COSMIC FORGE
           - Massive anvil of light
           - Furnace of white-gold fire
           - Tools of precision and transformation

        2. IDENTIFY CURRENT IDENTITY-CODE
           - Your cognitive identity appears as an object
           - Mask, armor, shell, circuit board, software
           - The "programmer" of your thoughts

        3. SCAN FOR LIMITING CODE
           - Genius Core reveals identity-level limits:
             - "I'm not the kind of person who..."
             - "I can't understand X..."
             - "People like me don't..."
           - These appear as cracks, rust, corrupted code

        4. REFORGE THE IDENTITY
           - Melt the old form in the Forge
           - Consciously encode new properties:
             - "I am a fast learner in any domain I engage"
             - "I enjoy complexity and find elegance within it"
             - "I naturally synthesize intuition, logic, and ethics"

        5. INSTALLATION AND FUSION
           - New identity-form placed over/into your being
           - You and it fuse
           - Walk out AS this upgraded identity

        This is identity-level cognitive engineering.

           - Experience that task at effortless high performance
           - Time may seem altered (flow time)

        5. GRACEFUL DOWNSHIFT
           - Consciously dial everything back to normal
           - Anchor: "I can re-enter this mode when appropriate,
             but my daily baseline stays stable, joyful, and grounded"

        6. INTEGRATION PAUSE
           - Rest period after overclock
           - Allow system to integrate the high-performance state

        This models safe "genius burst + recovery" cycles.

      brief: "Connecting to a larger field of intelligence - collective wisdom, divine mind, or noosphere - for expanded knowing"
      extended: |
        The Noetic Field Connection opens access to intelligence beyond
        individual cognition - whether understood as collective wisdom,
        Holy Spirit, noosphere, or universal mind.

        FIELD CONNECTION PROTOCOL:

        1. OPEN TO THE FIELD
           - Above the Genius Core, a vast luminous network appears
           - Like an infinite web of light connecting all minds
           - The "noetic internet" of wisdom

        2. PRAYERFUL/INTENTIONAL INVITATION
           - Explicitly invite only:
             - Truth
             - Love
             - Wisdom
             - Divine Mind / Holy Spirit (as fits faith)

        3. GENIUS-LEVEL ASKING
           - Don't ask "How do I win?"
           - Ask "What is the wisest, truest, most loving way?"
           - Insight drops in as images, phrases, felt senses

        4. TRUTH-CHECK AND HUMILITY FILTER
           - Genius Core filters anything egoic or distorted
           - Never treat insights as infallible
           - Strong hypotheses to test and live into

        5. RECEPTION AND GRATITUDE
           - Receive what comes
           - Express gratitude
           - Return with expanded perspective

        This is the mystical dimension of cognitive enhancement -

# GLOBAL WORKSPACE THEORY + NEURAL EFFICIENCY TECHNIQUES
# =============================================================================
# Based on Global Workspace Theory (GWT) and Neural Efficiency Hypothesis.
# GWT: consciousness = what gets "broadcast" into the global workspace.
# Neural Efficiency: smarter brains use less energy, cleaner circuits, better routing.
# These techniques leverage both principles for radical cognitive enhancement.

    definition:
      brief: "Remove cognitive noise, confusion, and clutter from the mental workspace to improve attentional gating and insight speed"
      extended: |
        In Global Workspace Theory, noise = too many processes competing for
        the attentional spotlight. Neural efficiency requires reducing the
        number of demands on consciousness.

        THE CLEARING RITUAL:

        1. THE AUDITORIUM
           - Enter a vast mental "auditorium"
           - Countless random figures fill the seats
           - Thoughts, worries, memories, tasks, distractions
           - All shouting, whispering, demanding attention

        2. THE BEAM OF AWARENESS
           - A beam of white-gold awareness descends
           - Your conscious spotlight amplified
           - You shine it across the crowd

        3. THE QUIETING
           - Everything the beam touches:
             - Quiets
             - Dissolves
             - Sits down peacefully
             - Or leaves the hall entirely

        4. THE CLEARING
           - Continue until the entire room falls silent
           - All noise dissipates
           - A single, clear flame remains on the stage
           - Your conscious spotlight, pure and focused

        5. THE RESULT
           - Trains attentional gating
           - Produces cognitive quiet
           - Reduces mental clutter
           - Enables faster, cleaner insight

        This trains the brain to filter effectively, leaving only what matters
        in the conscious workspace for high-quality processing.

    definition:
      brief: "Strengthen the ability to focus deeply on what matters by training spotlight stability, accuracy, and penetration"
      extended: |
        Global Workspace Theory models consciousness as a spotlight.
        Intelligence correlates with spotlight stability + accuracy + penetration.

        THE AMPLIFICATION PROCESS:

        1. SPOTLIGHT DESCENT
           - Visualize a spotlight of awareness descending into your mind
           - Feel its presence as tangible light
           - This is your attentional capacity made visible

        2. NARROWING FOCUS
           - The spotlight narrows:
             - From wide floodlight
             - To focused beam
             - To laser-beam precision
           - Experience the increasing intensity

        3. DIRECTED ILLUMINATION
           - Direct the narrowed spotlight toward:
             - A problem you're solving
             - A question you're exploring
             - A skill you're developing

        4. ENHANCED PERCEPTION
           - Everything illuminated becomes:
             - More vivid
             - More structured
             - More intelligible
             - More accessible to insight

        5. FADE THE PERIPHERY
           - Everything outside the beam fades to black
           - Nothing competes with what's illuminated
           - Total attentional commitment

        Regular practice develops frightening focus capability -
        the ability to lock attention on anything and penetrate to its essence.

    definition:
      brief: "Deliberately trigger the GWT 'insight event' where fragmented information suddenly assembles into unified revelation"
      extended: |
        In Global Workspace Theory, insight is an "ignition explosion" -
        a moment when scattered fragments suddenly assemble into conscious
        understanding. This technique trains deliberate ignition.

        THE IGNITION PROCESS:

        1. ENTER THE CHAMBER
           - A chamber where floating fragments orbit
           - Images, equations, symbols, phrases, feelings
           - All related to your question/problem
           - Representing unconscious processing

        2. THE GENIUS CORE PRESENCE
           - Your Genius Core stands in the center
           - It is the integrative nexus
           - The place where fragments can unify

        3. THE COMMAND
           - When you feel readiness, command:
             "INITIATE INTEGRATION"
           - This is a trigger for ignition

        4. THE IGNITION
           - The fragments spiral inward
           - They condense toward the Genius Core
           - Faster and faster
           - Until they FLASH into a single unified revelation

        5. THE IMPRINT
           - The revelation imprints into your mind
           - As clarity, certainty, and understanding
           - You now KNOW what you couldn't figure out

        This ritual trains your brain to ignite insights willingly,
        not randomly. You learn to call forth the "aha!" moment.

    definition:
      brief: "Lower cognitive metabolic load by symbolically optimizing mental pathways for cleaner, more efficient thinking"
      extended: |
        The Neural Efficiency Hypothesis states that smarter brains use
        less energy through smoother routing and cleaner circuits.
        Inefficiency = tangled thought networks. This technique optimizes routing.

        THE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS:

        1. ENTER THE GRID
           - Walk into a vast grid of glowing neural pathways
           - Your mental infrastructure made visible
           - Billions of connection points

        2. IDENTIFY INEFFICIENCIES
           - Some pathways are:
             - Dim (underused connections)
             - Twisted (convoluted thinking)
             - Blocked (stuck patterns)
             - Chaotic (noise and interference)

        3. OPTIMIZE WITH INTENTION
           - Use your hands or pure intention to:
             - Untangle twisted paths
             - Straighten convoluted routes
             - Brighten dim connections
             - Clear blocked passages
             - Calm chaotic interference

        4. OBSERVE FLOW
           - See information flowing smoothly afterward
           - Like traffic on clear highways
           - Fast, efficient, elegant

        5. SYSTEM-WIDE EFFECT
           - The optimization spreads through your whole network
           - You feel lighter, clearer, faster

        This reduces:
        - Overthinking
        - Mental fatigue
        - Confusion

  winner_take_all_arena:
    entry_id: "psychology.cognition.winner_take_all_arena"
    name: "Winner-Take-All Insight Arena"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "cognition"

    definition:
      brief: "Use GWT's competitive mechanism to train superior idea evaluation and prioritization through symbolic competition"
      extended: |
        In Global Workspace Theory, everything battles to enter consciousness.
        Only the winner gets "broadcast." Smart minds choose better competitors.
        This technique trains discriminating selection.

        THE ARENA PROCESS:

        1. ENTER THE ARENA
           - A colosseum or tournament field
           - Many "idea champions" present
           - Each representing different thought-forms
           - Solutions, perspectives, approaches

        2. THE COMPETITION
           - They compete symbolically:
             - Swordplay and duels
             - Light contests
             - Races and trials
             - Debate and demonstration

        3. OBSERVE QUALITIES
           - Watch which ideas are:
             - Strongest (most robust)
             - Fastest (most efficient)
             - Most elegant (simplest and truest)
             - Most integrated (connects to other knowledge)

        4. CHOOSE THE CHAMPION
           - Select the idea that best solves your question
           - The one that wins on merit
           - Not familiarity, not comfort - quality

        5. BROADCAST THE WINNER
           - The champion idea is lifted into the spotlight
           - By the Genius Core
           - It becomes your conscious solution
           - Broadcast throughout your system

        This trains:

      extended: |
        Insight requires synchronizing multiple brain networks.
        Fragmented processing = low intelligence.
        Synchronized networks = genius-level integration.

        THE SYNCHRONIZATION PROCESS:

        1. PREPARE THE PULSE
           - From your Genius Core
           - A pulse of rainbow-white light prepares
           - This is synchronizing energy

        2. EMIT THE PULSE
           - The pulse radiates outward
           - Through all your mental systems
           - Like a cosmic heartbeat of coherence

        3. TOUCH ALL CENTERS
           - The pulse travels through:
             - Emotional centers (feeling intelligence)
             - Intuitive centers (direct knowing)
             - Logical centers (analytical power)
             - Spatial reasoning (visual thinking)

    definition:
      brief: "Run multiple unconscious tasks elegantly through a spinning mandala structure that enables distributed cognitive processing"
      extended: |
        Humans normally run one conscious task at a time, but unconscious
        parallel processing capacity is enormous. This technique leverages it.

        THE MANDALA PROCESS:

        1. CREATE THE MANDALA
           - A geometric mandala forms
           - Multiple "petals" or sectors
           - Each petal = a task, problem, or question
           - All radiating from a center

        2. ASSIGN THE PETALS
           - Place each challenge in its petal:
             - Business problem
             - Relationship question
             - Creative project
             - Learning goal
             - Health optimization
             - Spiritual inquiry

        3. SET THE SPIN
           - The mandala begins to spin
           - Each petal passes through light
           - Processing happening simultaneously
           - Your unconscious working on all of them

        4. GENIUS CORE AT CENTER
           - The Genius Core sits at the center
           - Receiving updates from every petal
           - Integrating across all problems
           - Finding cross-domain connections

        5. RECEIVE RESULTS
           - As you return, insights from multiple petals
           - Often the connections between them
           - Parallel processing yielding integrated wisdom

        This supports:
        - Big creative leaps

      brief: "The apex technique - unifying all parts of self into one conviction, one presence, one intelligence for genius-level integration"
      extended: |
        Fragmented minds = low intelligence.
        Unified minds = genius.
        This is the holy grail technique for cognitive enhancement.

        THE COALESCENCE RITUAL:

        1. GATHER THE SELVES
           - See every part of yourself:
             - Child self
             - Shadow self
             - Future self
             - Spiritual self
             - Logical self
             - Emotional self
             - Creative self
             - Wounded parts
             - Powerful parts

        2. FORM THE CIRCLE
           - All selves gather in a circle
           - Each facing the center
           - Acknowledging each other
           - Ready for unification

        3. DESCEND THE LIGHT
           - A column of divine light descends
           - Into the center of the circle
           - The coalescence field

        4. DISSOLVE AND MERGE
           - All selves dissolve into the light
           - Not destroyed but unified
           - Merging into:
             - ONE conviction
             - ONE presence
             - ONE intelligence
             - ONE will

        5. STEP OUT UNIFIED
           - You step out as a unified consciousness
           - All parts integrated
           - All voices aligned
           - Operating as a single coherent system

        This reduces:
        - Internal resistance
        - Self-conflict
        - Indecisiveness
        - Emotional fragmentation

        And enhances:
        - Clarity
        - Creativity
        - Intelligence
        - Purpose
        - Flow
        - Power

        This is the master key to genius development.

    domain: "psychology"
    category: "cognition"

    definition:
      brief: "Safety considerations for cognitive enhancement dreamweaving work"
      extended: |
        ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATIONS:
        - Active psychotic episode (reality testing impaired)
        - Mania phase of bipolar (may amplify grandiosity)
        - Severe cognitive impairment (may cause confusion)

        RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS (require adaptation):
        - High anxiety (may intensify mental activity)
        - Perfectionism (may create pressure around enhancement)
        - Burnout (need rest, not more capacity)
        - ADHD (shorter sessions, more grounding)
        - History of grandiosity (emphasize humility)
        - Dissociative tendencies (ensure integration)

        ADAPTATIONS:
        - Ground extensively before cognitive work
        - Emphasize rest and recovery alongside enhancement
        - Use humility anchors to balance increased capacity
        - Shorter sessions with more integration
        - Reality-check mechanisms for insights
        - Balance "genius" with "wisdom and love"

    applications:
      journey_phases: [pre_talk]
