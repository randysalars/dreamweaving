      brief: "The unconscious pattern-matching system that detects meaningful connections before conscious awareness"
      extended: |
        Intuition operates through massive parallel pattern recognition in the
        brain's right hemisphere and limbic system. The unconscious mind processes
        approximately 11 million bits of information per second, while conscious
        awareness handles only 40-50 bits. This creates a vast reservoir of
        pattern-matched data that surfaces as intuitive knowing, gut feelings,
        or sudden insights.

        The pattern recognition system draws on:
        - Accumulated life experience encoded in implicit memory
        - Somatic markers stored in the body's cellular memory
        - Archetypal patterns from the collective unconscious
        - Quantum field information accessible in expanded states

        Dreamweaving sessions can train this system to recognize deeper patterns,
        trust its outputs, and integrate intuitive knowing with rational analysis.

    definition:
      brief: "The body's innate wisdom system that communicates through sensation, feeling, and gut knowing"
      extended: |
        Somatic intelligence refers to the body's capacity for knowing that
        bypasses cognitive processing. This system includes:

        - Interoception: awareness of internal bodily states
        - Gut-brain axis: the enteric nervous system's independent processing
        - Somatic markers: Antonio Damasio's emotional body-memory system
        - Cellular memory: experiential encoding in body tissues
        - Heart intelligence: the heart's electromagnetic field processing

        The body often knows before the mind. A tightening in the chest, a
        relaxation in the belly, tingling in the hands - these are the body's
        wisdom speaking. Dreamweaving trains practitioners to recognize,
        trust, and dialogue with somatic intelligence.

        Key practices include:
        - Body scanning for intuitive signals
        - "Yes/No" somatic calibration (how does truth feel vs. untruth?)
        - Gut feeling amplification techniques
        - Heart coherence intuition protocols

  # IMAGINAL SYMBOLIC MESSAGING

  imaginal_symbolic:
    entry_id: "psychology.intuition.imaginal_symbolic"
    name: "Imaginal Symbolic Messaging"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "intuition"

    definition:
      brief: "The language of the unconscious expressed through spontaneous images, symbols, and metaphors"
      extended: |
        The unconscious mind communicates primarily through images and symbols
        rather than linear language. Carl Jung termed this the "imaginal realm" -
        a dimension of consciousness where meaning manifests as living imagery.

        Types of imaginal communication:
        - Spontaneous inner images (active imagination)
        - Dream symbols and narratives
        - Synchronistic outer events
        - Archetypal visitations
        - Hypnagogic/hypnopompic imagery

        The imaginal operates by its own logic:
        - Symbolic equation (one thing stands for another)
        - Condensation (multiple meanings in single image)
        - Displacement (emotional charge transferred)
        - Amplification (symbol expands in meaning)

        Dreamweaving works directly with imaginal language, translating
        between conscious intention and unconscious symbolism.

  # PREDICTIVE PROCESSING

  predictive_processing:

    name: "Predictive Processing Intuition"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "intuition"

    definition:
      brief: "The brain's reality-modeling system that generates expectations and highlights prediction errors as intuitive alerts"
      extended: |
        The brain is fundamentally a prediction engine. It constantly generates
        models of expected reality and compares incoming data against these
        predictions. When predictions match experience, we feel settled and
        certain. When they don't match, we experience prediction error - often
        felt as intuitive unease, "something's off," or sudden attention shifts.

        Intuition leverages this system by:
        - Detecting subtle prediction errors before conscious recognition
        - Generating "future memory" simulations of outcomes
        - Creating felt-sense of trajectory misalignment
        - Producing sudden knowing when models click into place

        Dreamweaving can enhance predictive intuition by:
        - Training sensitivity to prediction error signals
        - Practicing "future self" consultations
        - Developing outcome trajectory sensing
        - Installing enhanced prediction models

    definition:
      brief: "A structured protocol for accessing intuitive guidance through systematic inner consultation"
      extended: |
        The Inner Oracle Inquiry Sequence (IOIS) is a systematic method for
        consulting one's intuitive wisdom. It combines multiple intuition
        channels for comprehensive guidance.

        The IOIS Protocol:

        1. GROUND & CENTER (2-3 minutes)
           - Establish breath rhythm
           - Drop into body awareness
           - Create inner sanctuary space

        2. FORMULATE INQUIRY (1-2 minutes)
           - Clarify the question precisely
           - Feel into what you truly want to know
           - Release attachment to specific answers

        3. SOMATIC SCAN (2-3 minutes)
           - Ask the question to your body
           - Notice gut response, heart response
           - Calibrate yes/no body signals

        4. IMAGINAL RECEPTION (3-5 minutes)
           - Open to spontaneous imagery
           - Allow symbols, scenes, figures to appear
           - Receive without interpreting yet

        5. DIALOGUE (2-3 minutes)
           - Ask follow-up questions of images/guides
           - Listen for verbal/felt responses
           - Request clarification if needed

        6. INTEGRATION (2-3 minutes)
           - Synthesize somatic and imaginal data
           - Distill core message
           - Set intention or action step

        7. GRATITUDE & CLOSE (1 minute)
           - Thank inner wisdom sources
           - Ground back to ordinary awareness
           - Record insights immediately

  # LIMINAL APERTURE METHOD

  liminal_aperture:

    name: "Liminal Aperture Method"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "intuition"

    definition:
      brief: "A technique for accessing intuitive knowing through the threshold states between waking and sleep"
      extended: |
        The liminal aperture is the doorway between states of consciousness -
        particularly the hypnagogic (waking to sleep) and hypnopompic (sleep to
        waking) transitions. In these threshold states, the critical faculty
        relaxes while imaginal capacities heighten, creating optimal conditions
        for intuitive reception.

        The Liminal Aperture Method:

        1. APPROACH THE THRESHOLD
           - Relax body deeply while maintaining mental alertness
           - Use breath to induce hypnagogic state
           - Notice the moment awareness begins to drift

        2. HOLD THE APERTURE OPEN
           - Maintain delicate balance at threshold
           - Don't fall into sleep; don't wake fully
           - Use micro-attention movements to stabilize

        3. POSE THE INQUIRY
           - Gently introduce the question
           - Release into the liminal space
           - Allow spontaneous responses

        4. RECEIVE & RECORD
           - Notice imagery, words, feelings arising
           - Anchor memorable details
           - Return to full waking to document

        This method was used by Edison (holding steel balls to wake before
        sleep), Dali (spoon technique), and many inventors and artists for
        creative breakthrough and intuitive insight.

  # SYMBOL DRIFT TECHNIQUE

  symbol_drift:

    name: "Symbol Drift Technique"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "intuition"

    definition:
      brief: "A free-association method allowing symbols to transform and reveal deeper meanings through natural drift"
      extended: |
        Symbol Drift is a technique for allowing intuitive imagery to evolve
        and reveal deeper layers of meaning through gentle, non-directed
        transformation. Rather than interpreting symbols directly, the
        practitioner allows them to shift and change, following the natural
        flow of unconscious association.

        The Symbol Drift Protocol:

        1. RECEIVE INITIAL SYMBOL
           - Allow a spontaneous image to arise
           - Don't analyze; simply observe

        2. SOFTEN ATTENTION
           - Hold symbol loosely
           - Allow edges to become permeable

        3. OBSERVE TRANSFORMATION
           - Watch how the symbol wants to change
           - Follow the drift without directing
           - Note what it becomes

        4. FOLLOW THE CHAIN
           - Allow new symbol to also drift
           - Continue through 3-7 transformations
           - Note the journey

        5. RECOGNIZE ARRIVAL
           - Know when the drift has completed
           - A sense of "arrival" or "home"
           - Final symbol carries integrated meaning

        6. INTEGRATE THE JOURNEY
           - Review the transformation sequence
           - Each step reveals a layer of meaning
           - The path IS the message

    definition:
      brief: "A breathwork technique that uses specific patterns to access intuitive states and receive guidance"
      extended: |
        The Breath of Knowing utilizes conscious breath patterns to shift
        brainwave states and access intuitive knowing. Different breath
        patterns activate different modes of consciousness.

        Core Breath Patterns:

        1. RECEPTIVE BREATH (for receiving intuition)
           - Long slow inhale (6-8 counts)
           - Extended exhale (8-10 counts)
           - Opens parasympathetic receptivity

        2. ACTIVATING BREATH (for clarity/discrimination)
           - Quick rhythmic breathing (30-60 seconds)
           - Followed by breath hold
           - Intuitive "download" during hold

        3. COHERENCE BREATH (for heart intelligence)
           - Equal inhale/exhale (5-5 or 6-6)
           - Attention on heart
           - Access heart-brain intuition

        4. INQUIRY BREATH
           - Inhale the question
           - Hold in the mystery
           - Exhale into receiving
           - Answer arises in the space after exhale

        The breath is the bridge between conscious and unconscious, voluntary
        and involuntary. Through breath, we can navigate the waters of
        intuitive knowing.

  # FUTURE ECHO

  future_echo:
    entry_id: "psychology.intuition.future_echo"
    name: "Future Echo Technique"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "intuition"

    definition:
      brief: "A method for receiving intuitive guidance by sensing reverberations from future outcomes back through time"
      extended: |
        The Future Echo technique works on the principle that significant
        future events cast shadows backward through time. Just as a stone
        dropped in water creates ripples that move outward, major life events
        create ripples that we can sense before they occur.

        The Future Echo Protocol:

        1. ATTUNE TO THE TIME STREAM
           - Enter theta state
           - Expand temporal awareness
           - Feel the flow of time as non-linear

        2. PROJECT ATTENTION FORWARD
           - Mentally move consciousness into the future
           - Visit the moment AFTER the decision/event
           - Feel what it's like to be there

        3. SENSE THE ECHO
           - From that future position, look back
           - What echoes/reverberations do you sense?
           - What feeling-tone reaches back to now?

        4. COMPARE TRAJECTORIES
           - Do this for multiple possible futures
           - Which future sends the strongest positive echo?
           - Which feels most "true" or "real"?

        5. TRUST THE RESONANCE
           - The path that echoes with rightness
           - That feels inevitable and aligned
           - Is your intuitive guidance

        This technique aligns with both quantum retrocausality theories and
        ancestral indigenous practices of consulting with future selves.

    definition:
      brief: "A technique for assembling and consulting an internal advisory board of wisdom figures for guidance"
      extended: |
        The Inner Council is a structured imaginal practice for receiving
        multifaceted guidance from internalized wisdom figures. Rather than
        consulting a single inner voice, the practitioner convenes a council
        of diverse perspectives.

        Council Assembly:

        1. THE SAGE (Wisdom/Knowledge)
           - Represents accumulated learning
           - Offers rational, experienced perspective

        2. THE HEART (Compassion/Values)
           - Represents emotional wisdom
           - Offers value-aligned guidance

        3. THE CHILD (Intuition/Play)
           - Represents innocent knowing
           - Offers unexpected insights

        4. THE BODY (Somatic/Practical)
           - Represents physical wisdom
           - Offers grounded, realistic input

        5. THE HIGHER SELF (Spiritual/Transcendent)
           - Represents eternal perspective
           - Offers soul-level guidance

        6. WILDCARDS (Optional)
           - Ancestral figure
           - Future self
           - Archetypal guide
           - Historical mentor

        The council deliberates on the presented question, each offering their
        perspective, until consensus or clarity emerges.

        The Higher Self (also known as the Oversoul, Atman, the Christ
        Within, Buddha Nature, or Neshamah) is understood as the eternal,
        perfect aspect of individual consciousness that maintains connection
        with universal wisdom. Unlike guides (experienced as "other"), the
        Higher Self is experienced as the deepest "I" - who you truly are
        beyond personality.

        MODELS OF THE HIGHER SELF:

        1. PSYCHOLOGICAL MODEL
           - The Self (Jungian) - integrating center of psyche
           - Ideal self - one's highest potential realized
           - Meta-awareness - the observer of all experience

        2. SPIRITUAL MODEL
           - The soul/eternal essence
           - The divine spark within
           - The individualized expression of Source

        3. QUANTUM MODEL

           - Sense the presence of your true nature
           - Allow personality to become transparent
           - Recognize yourself as more than you thought

        3. MERGER
           - Let boundaries between self and Self soften
           - Experience temporary unification
           - Download wisdom from this expanded state

        4. INTEGRATION

    definition:
      brief: "A rapid stream-of-consciousness technique for accessing intuitive imagery by describing spontaneous inner visuals aloud"
      extended: |
        Image Streaming, developed by Win Wenger, is a technique for
        accessing the non-verbal intelligence of the visual cortex. By
        describing inner imagery aloud in rapid, continuous flow, the
        conscious mind is occupied while the unconscious generates a
        stream of meaningful imagery.

        THE IMAGE STREAMING PROTOCOL:

        1. RELAX AND CLOSE EYES
           - Establish light trance state
           - Allow visual field to become receptive

        2. DESCRIBE ALOUD IMMEDIATELY
           - Whatever appears - describe it
           - If nothing appears, describe the darkness
           - Keep talking continuously

        3. USE ALL SENSES
           - Not just visual - add texture, sound, smell
           - "I see... I feel... I hear..."
           - Multi-sensory anchors the imagery

        4. DON'T INTERPRET - DESCRIBE
           - Raw description, not analysis
           - "A red ball" not "which represents..."
           - Analysis comes later

        5. FOLLOW THE STREAM
           - Let images transform naturally
           - Don't direct, just witness and describe
           - Trust the flow

        6. RECORD AND ANALYZE
           - Record the session
           - Review for patterns and insights
           - Intuitive knowing emerges from the stream

        Image Streaming has been shown to increase IQ scores and creative
        problem-solving ability. For Dreamweaving, it provides raw material
        for journey construction and accesses client's personal symbol language.

    category: "guidance"

    definition:
      brief: "A technique for bypassing conscious filters to receive written communication from deeper knowing or guide sources"
      extended: |
        Automatic writing (also called psychography or channeled writing) is
        a practice where the hand writes without conscious direction, allowing
        unconscious material or guide communication to flow through the pen.

        TYPES OF AUTOMATIC WRITING:

        1. UNCONSCIOUS AUTOMATIC
           - Hand moves independently
           - Writer may not be aware of content
           - Pure automaticity

        2. INTUITIVE/INSPIRED WRITING
           - Conscious but not directing
           - Words flow faster than thought
           - "Taking dictation" feeling

        3. DIALOGUE WRITING
           - Intentional questions posed
           - Answers written automatically
           - Conscious collaboration with source

        AUTOMATIC WRITING PROTOCOL:

        1. PREPARATION
           - Set sacred space
           - State intention clearly
           - Have paper and pen ready (or keyboard)

        2. INDUCTION
           - Enter light trance
           - Focus attention on third eye or heart
           - Allow conscious mind to drift

        3. INVITATION
           - Invite wisdom to flow through the hand
           - Ask a question if doing dialogue format
           - Release expectation

        4. WRITING
           - Begin with circles or random marks
           - Allow words to emerge
           - Don't read while writing
           - Continue without stopping

        5. CLOSING
           - Thank the source
           - Ground and return
           - Read what was written

        For Dreamweaving, automatic writing can extract personalized guidance,
        journey themes, and symbolic material from client's unconscious.

    definition:
      brief: "Using tarot archetypes and imagery as a structured symbol system for generating personalized journey content"
      extended: |
        The Tarot is a complete symbolic language containing 78 archetypal
        images that map the full spectrum of human experience. For Dreamweaving,
        the Tarot serves not as divination but as a symbol engine - a way to
        access specific archetypal energies and journey motifs.

        TAROT AS SYMBOL SYSTEM:

        MAJOR ARCANA (22 Cards)
        - The Fool's Journey structure
        - Primary life archetypes
        - Transformation stages

    definition:
      brief: "Techniques for inducing trance through gazing at reflective surfaces to receive visions and guidance"
      extended: |
        Skrying (also scrying) is the practice of gazing into reflective or
        translucent surfaces to induce altered states and receive visionary
        information. The surface acts as a focal point that occupies the
        conscious mind while freeing the unconscious to produce imagery.

        SKRYING SURFACES:

        1. CRYSTAL BALL (Crystallomancy)
           - Classic European method
           - Clear or slightly clouded quartz
           - Images appear "within" the sphere

        2. BLACK MIRROR (Catoptromancy)
           - Dr. John Dee's obsidian mirror
           - Black surface allows projected imagery
           - Powerful for shadow work

        3. WATER BOWL (Hydromancy)
           - Dark bowl with still water
           - Ancient Greek oracle method
           - Accessible and effective

        4. FLAME GAZING (Pyromancy)
           - Candle flame or fire
           - Images in flickering light
           - Good for transformation themes

        5. SMOKE READING (Capnomancy)
           - Incense or sacred smoke
           - Shapes and movements interpreted
           - Common in shamanic traditions

        SKRYING PROTOCOL FOR DREAMWEAVING:

        1. PREPARATION
           - Dim lighting, quiet space
           - Surface positioned at comfortable angle
           - Relaxed but alert posture

        2. SOFT GAZE
           - Look through, not at, the surface
           - Relax eye muscles
           - Allow vision to soften and expand

        3. INDUCTION
           - Breath pacing
           - Gentle trance deepening
           - Surface becomes gateway

        4. RECEPTION
           - Images, colors, or impressions arise
           - Don't grasp or analyze
           - Simply witness and receive

        5. INTERPRETATION
           - After session, review what was seen

  pendulum_adaptation:

    name: "Pendulum Adaptation for Dreamweaving"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "guidance"

    definition:
      brief: "Using pendulum or ideomotor responses to access unconscious knowing through subtle body movements"
      extended: |
        The pendulum is a tool for amplifying ideomotor responses - subtle
        unconscious muscle movements that reflect inner knowing. The pendulum
        doesn't "know" anything; rather, it magnifies the body's micro-
        expressions of unconscious information.

        IDEOMOTOR MECHANISM:

        The unconscious mind influences tiny muscle movements. These movements
        are too subtle to perceive directly but can be amplified by:
        - Pendulum swinging (traditional)
        - Finger signals (hypnotherapy)
        - Whole-body sway (standing meditation)
        - Autonomic responses (skin conductance)

        PENDULUM PROTOCOL:

        1. CALIBRATION
           - Establish "yes" movement (e.g., clockwise)
           - Establish "no" movement (e.g., counterclockwise)
           - Establish "don't know" or "rephrase" signal

        2. QUESTIONING
           - Ask clear yes/no questions
           - Hold pendulum still, await movement
           - Trust the first clear response

        3. VERIFICATION
           - Ask known-answer questions to verify
           - Check consistency
           - Build trust in the system

        DREAMWEAVING APPLICATIONS:

        1. JOURNEY THEME SELECTION
           - Ask "Is X the right theme for this journey?"
           - Narrow down from multiple options

        2. ARCHETYPE IDENTIFICATION
           - Ask "Is the guide for this work masculine/feminine?"
           - Ask about specific archetypes

        3. BODY WISDOM ACCESS
           - "Does my body want to release in this area?"
           - "Is there unconscious resistance here?"

        4. TIMELINE CHECKING
           - "Did this pattern originate in childhood?"
           - "Is there ancestral material here?"

        Note: For Dreamweaving, the practitioner can use pendulum in preparation,
        or teach client to use ideomotor finger signals during session.

    definition:
      brief: "Napoleon Hill's technique of convening an imaginal council of historical figures and masters for guidance and inspiration"
      extended: |
        In "Think and Grow Rich" and later "The Master Key to Riches,"
        Napoleon Hill described his practice of nightly meetings with an
        "Invisible Counselors" - imagined historical figures whose qualities
        he wished to develop. Over time, these figures became so vivid they
        seemed to take on independent life and provide unexpected guidance.

        HILL'S ORIGINAL COUNCIL:
        - Emerson (understanding of nature)
        - Paine (freedom of thought)
        - Edison (faith and persistence)
        - Darwin (patience)
        - Lincoln (humor, tolerance)
        - Burbank (harmony with nature)
        - Napoleon (decisiveness, organization)
        - Ford (concentration, self-reliance)
        - Carnegie (practical achievement)

        THE COUNCIL OF MASTERS PROTOCOL:

        1. SELECTION
           - Choose 5-12 figures whose qualities you want to embody
           - Can be historical, fictional, archetypal, or living
           - Ensure diversity of perspectives

        2. RESEARCH
           - Study each figure deeply
           - Know their stories, voices, mannerisms
           - Understand their wisdom and approach

        3. CONVENING
           - Enter trance/deep relaxation
           - Visualize council chamber
           - Call each member by name, see them take their seat

        4. DIALOGUE
           - Present your question/situation
           - Let each member respond in turn
           - Listen for unexpected insights

        5. INTEGRATION
           - Thank the council
           - Close the session formally
           - Record the guidance received

        DREAMWEAVING COUNCIL VARIATIONS:

        - Archetype Council (Sage, Warrior, Lover, King/Queen, Magician, etc.)
        - Ancestral Council (known and unknown ancestors)
        - Future Selves Council (versions at different ages/achievements)
        - Saints and Masters Council (Jesus, Buddha, Mary, etc.)

  living_symbols:
    entry_id: "psychology.future_tech.living_symbols"
    name: "Living Symbols"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "future_tech"

    definition:
      brief: "Autonomous, self-evolving symbolic constructs that continue to unfold and generate meaning over time"
      extended: |
        Living Symbols represent an evolution beyond static imagery. Where
        traditional symbols are fixed (a cross, a mandala, an archetype),
        Living Symbols are implanted constructs that continue to grow,
        transform, and reveal new layers of meaning over days, weeks, or
        years.

        CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVING SYMBOLS:

        1. SELF-EVOLUTION
           - The symbol changes over time
           - Each encounter reveals new aspects
           - Growth reflects practitioner's development

        2. RESPONSIVE AWARENESS
           - Symbol responds to practitioner's state
           - Different forms for different needs
           - Intelligent adaptation

        3. MEANING GENERATION
           - Continuously produces new insights
           - Unpredictable wisdom emergence
           - Self-complexifying over time

        4. RELATIONSHIP CAPACITY
           - Forms relationship with practitioner
           - Two-way communication develops
           - Symbol has "personality"

        LIVING SYMBOL IMPLANTATION:

        1. CONCEPTION
           - In deep trance, receive initial symbol seed
           - Often arrives spontaneously from unconscious
           - Unique to the individual

        2. PLANTING
           - Visualize symbol taking root in psyche
           - Usually heart, belly, or third eye location
           - Anchor with breath and intention

        3. NURTURING
           - Regular attention and dialogue
           - Feed with presence and curiosity
           - Allow organic development

        4. HARVESTING
           - Periodic deep consultations
           - Extract accumulated wisdom
           - Note transformations

        For Dreamweaving, Living Symbols can be implanted during sessions
        and revisited in subsequent work, creating continuity and deepening
        across multiple journeys.

  # SEMANTIC FRACTALS

  semantic_fractals:
    entry_id: "psychology.future_tech.semantic_fractals"
    name: "Semantic Fractals"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "future_tech"

    definition:
      brief: "Self-similar meaning structures that contain the whole within each part, allowing infinite depth exploration"
      extended: |
        Semantic Fractals are meaning-structures that exhibit fractal
        properties - the whole is contained within each part, and zooming
        in reveals infinite recursive depth. In consciousness work, this
        means that any symbol or concept, when deeply explored, contains
        the totality of wisdom relevant to the practitioner.

        FRACTAL MEANING PRINCIPLES:

        1. SELF-SIMILARITY AT SCALE
           - The microcosm reflects the macrocosm
           - Any part contains the pattern of the whole
           - "As above, so below"

        2. INFINITE DEPTH
           - Every symbol can be infinitely explored
           - No "bottom" to meaning
           - Always more to discover

        3. RECURSIVE STRUCTURE
           - Each level contains the next
           - Patterns within patterns
           - Nested meaning-sets

        4. EMERGENT COMPLEXITY
           - Simple rules create complex results
           - Deep structure generates surface variety
           - Underlying unity in apparent diversity

        SEMANTIC FRACTAL EXPLORATION:

        1. SELECT SEED SYMBOL
           - Start with any meaningful image/concept
           - This is your entry point

        2. ZOOM IN
           - Focus on one detail of the symbol
           - Let that detail become its own whole
           - Explore the symbol-within-symbol

        3. DISCOVER RESONANCE
           - Notice how inner symbol reflects outer
           - See the fractal pattern
           - Recognize self-similarity

        4. ZOOM IN AGAIN
           - Choose element within inner symbol
           - Continue the descent
           - Each level reveals new knowing

        5. RETURN WITH INTEGRATION
           - Carry the depth-wisdom back up
           - See how it illuminates original symbol
           - Integration of scales

        This technique allows a single Dreamweaving session to access
        potentially infinite wisdom from a single starting image.

  # SYMBOLIC OPERATORS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  symbolic_operators:
    entry_id: "psychology.future_tech.symbolic_operators"
    name: "Symbolic Operators"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "future_tech"

    definition:
      brief: "Functional symbol-forms that perform specific transformations on consciousness states when activated"
      extended: |
        Symbolic Operators are symbols that DO something - they are
        functional rather than merely representational. Where a traditional
        symbol represents a meaning, a Symbolic Operator transforms a state.

        TYPES OF SYMBOLIC OPERATORS:

        1. TRANSFORMATION OPERATORS
           - Convert one state to another
           - Example: Phoenix (transforms old into new)
           - Example: Alchemical vessel (transmutes content)

        2. AMPLIFICATION OPERATORS
           - Intensify existing states
           - Example: Spiral (deepens any experience)
           - Example: Sun (amplifies energy/clarity)

        3. FILTERING OPERATORS
           - Remove or pass specific content
           - Example: Sieve (lets go what's unnecessary)
           - Example: Mirror (reflects back only truth)

        4. INTEGRATION OPERATORS
           - Combine disparate elements
           - Example: Infinity loop (unites opposites)
           - Example: Chalice (blends contents)

        5. NAVIGATION OPERATORS
           - Direct movement through consciousness
           - Example: Door (creates passage)
           - Example: Bridge (connects realms)

        6. PROTECTION OPERATORS
           - Shield or contain
           - Example: Circle (creates boundary)
           - Example: Shield (deflects)

        USING SYMBOLIC OPERATORS:

        1. SELECTION
           - Identify the operation needed
           - Choose appropriate operator

        2. ACTIVATION
           - Visualize the operator clearly
           - Apply it to target state/content
           - Feel its function operating

        3. COMPLETION
           - Allow operation to complete
           - Notice the transformed result
           - Release the operator

        For Dreamweaving, Operators can be taught to clients as tools for
        self-transformation between sessions.

    definition:
      brief: "Internalized archetypal patterns that process experience in parallel with conscious awareness, providing continuous guidance"
      extended: |
        Archetypal Co-Processors are internalized archetypal patterns that
        run continuously in the background of consciousness, processing
        experience through their unique perspective and providing ongoing
        input to awareness.

        CONCEPT:

        Just as a computer can have specialized co-processors (GPU for
        graphics, TPU for AI), the psyche can be equipped with specialized
        archetypal processors that handle specific types of experience.

        COMMON CO-PROCESSOR ARCHETYPES:

        1. THE WARRIOR (Action Assessment)
           - Continuously evaluates: "What must be done?"
           - Provides courage when needed
           - Detects threats and opportunities

        2. THE SAGE (Wisdom Integration)
           - Continuously asks: "What can be learned?"
           - Provides perspective
           - Connects patterns across experiences

        3. THE HEALER (Wellness Monitoring)
           - Continuously senses: "What needs attention?"
           - Provides self-care prompts
           - Detects imbalance early

        4. THE LOVER (Connection Awareness)
           - Continuously notices: "What wants to connect?"
           - Provides relational intelligence
           - Senses emotional currents

        5. THE SOVEREIGN (Authority/Direction)
           - Continuously guides: "What is the priority?"
           - Provides decision clarity
           - Maintains purpose alignment

        INSTALLATION PROTOCOL:

        1. CHOOSE ARCHETYPE
           - Select needed co-processor
           - Study its qualities deeply

        2. DEEP INTERNALIZATION
           - Meditative absorption of archetype
           - "Become" the archetype temporarily
           - Download its operating patterns

        3. INSTALLATION
           - Place archetype in psyche location
           - Usually heart, head, or belly
           - Activate continuous operation

        4. CALIBRATION
           - Adjust sensitivity
           - Set communication channels
           - Test operation

        Once installed, co-processors run automatically, enhancing
        perception and providing continuous archetypal perspective.

  holographic_symbolism:
    entry_id: "psychology.future_tech.holographic_symbolism"
    name: "Holographic Symbolism"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "future_tech"

    definition:
      brief: "Three-dimensional living symbol systems that contain complete information about the whole in every fragment"
      extended: |
        Holographic Symbolism draws on the holographic principle - that in
        a hologram, every part contains information about the whole. Applied
        to symbolic cognition, this means developing symbols that are fully
        three-dimensional, internally consistent, and complete.

        HOLOGRAPHIC SYMBOL PROPERTIES:

        1. THREE-DIMENSIONALITY
           - Symbol can be rotated in mental space
           - Different angles reveal different aspects
           - Full sculptural presence

        2. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY
           - Symbol works from all perspectives
           - No hidden flaws or contradictions
           - Self-coherent in all dimensions

        3. INFORMATION DENSITY
           - Any fragment contains the whole
           - Cut anywhere, still complete
           - Maximum meaning compression

        4. INTERFERENCE PATTERNS
           - Multiple symbols can combine
           - Create interference patterns of meaning
           - Emergent complexity from combination

        CREATING HOLOGRAPHIC SYMBOLS:

        1. CONCEPTUAL CLARITY
           - What is the core meaning?
           - What must be preserved from all angles?

        2. 3D CONSTRUCTION
           - Build symbol in mental space
           - Rotate and refine
           - Ensure all-angle coherence

        3. INFORMATION ENCODING
           - Compress meaning into form
           - Embed multiple layers
           - Test fragment integrity

        4. ACTIVATION
           - Symbol becomes "alive" in psyche
           - Can be accessed from any angle
           - Contains complete wisdom

        For Dreamweaving, Holographic Symbols provide rich, explorable
        symbolic environments rather than flat imagery.

    name: "Symbolic Entanglement"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "future_tech"

    definition:
      brief: "Creating quantum-like correlations between symbols so that change in one instantly affects its entangled partner"
      extended: |
        Symbolic Entanglement borrows from quantum mechanics the concept of
        entangled particles - once entangled, measuring one instantly
        affects the other regardless of distance. In symbolic cognition,
        we can create correlations between symbols such that transforming
        one automatically transforms its pair.

        APPLICATIONS OF SYMBOLIC ENTANGLEMENT:

        1. SELF-OTHER ENTANGLEMENT
           - Entangle symbol of self with symbol of other
           - Healing self-symbol heals relationship
           - Boundary work through disentanglement

        2. PRESENT-FUTURE ENTANGLEMENT
           - Entangle present state with desired future
           - Changes in present-symbol ripple forward
           - Manifestation through entangled transformation

        3. CONSCIOUS-UNCONSCIOUS ENTANGLEMENT
           - Entangle surface issue with root cause
           - Transforming surface affects depths
           - Integration through entangled processing

        4. INDIVIDUAL-COLLECTIVE ENTANGLEMENT
           - Entangle personal symbol with archetype
           - Personal transformation taps collective power
           - Healing the one heals the many

        ENTANGLEMENT PROTOCOL:

        1. IDENTIFY PAIR
           - What two elements need to be linked?
           - Create clear symbols for each

        2. BRING INTO RESONANCE
           - Visualize symbols side by side
           - Find the frequency where they vibrate together
           - Achieve harmonic resonance

        3. ENTANGLE
           - Merge symbols momentarily
           - Then separate while maintaining connection
           - Feel the invisible link

        4. TEST
           - Change one symbol slightly
           - Observe instant change in partner
           - Confirm entanglement

        5. UTILIZE
           - Transform the more accessible symbol
           - Trust the entangled effect
           - Verify changes in partner

    name: "Meaning Density Modulation"
    domain: "psychology"
    category: "future_tech"

    definition:
      brief: "The ability to compress or expand the density of meaning within symbolic containers for different purposes"
      extended: |
        Meaning Density refers to how much significance is packed into a
        given symbol or experience. Some symbols are "heavy" with meaning
        (a wedding ring); others are "light" (a pencil). Meaning Density
        Modulation is the skill of intentionally adjusting this density.

        DENSITY SPECTRUM:

        LOW DENSITY
        - Symbol carries minimal meaning
        - Light, casual, easily changed
        - Example: Random doodle

        MEDIUM DENSITY
        - Symbol carries moderate significance
        - Personal meaning but not sacred
        - Example: Favorite coffee mug

        HIGH DENSITY
        - Symbol saturated with meaning
        - Sacred, archetypal, numinous
        - Example: Religious icon, wedding ring

        MAXIMUM DENSITY
        - Symbol contains infinite meaning
        - The symbol IS reality, not represents it
        - Example: The Tao, the Cross in mystical experience

        MODULATION TECHNIQUES:

        1. DENSIFYING (Increasing)
           - Add layers of association
           - Connect to archetypes
           - Ritualize and sacralize
           - Repeated meaningful encounters

        2. DILUTING (Decreasing)
           - Detach associations
           - Normalize and desacralize
           - Create distance and perspective
           - Replace charged symbol with neutral

        APPLICATIONS:

        - TRAUMA: Dilute meaning density of traumatic symbols
        - MANIFESTATION: Densify symbols of desired outcomes
        - SPIRITUAL: Densify practice symbols for deeper access
        - FLEXIBILITY: Dilute rigid symbols blocking growth

        The skill allows practitioners to consciously engineer the
        significance landscape of their inner world.
