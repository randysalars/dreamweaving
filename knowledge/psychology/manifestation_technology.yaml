  description: |
    Complete manifestation framework integrating cognitive neuroscience, quantum field
    metaphors, esoteric traditions (magick, prayer, witchcraft), and future consciousness
    technologies. Provides Dreamweaving templates for facilitating reality transformation.

  core_insight: |
    Your brain is a prediction machine, not a passive observer. It generates reality
    before you experience it. When someone performs manifestation, affirmation, or
    intention work, they are modifying the brain's predictive model—and the world
    reorganizes around that internal shift.

    definition:
      brief: "The brain predicts incoming sensory data and adjusts perception, embodiment, and action accordingly"
      extended: |
        Your brain does not wait for reality—you predict incoming sensory data and then
        adjust what you perceive, embody, and act upon. When the internal model shifts,
        the brain filters reality differently, noticing opportunities, possibilities,
        and pathways previously invisible. Behavior automatically adapts to fulfill
        the new prediction.

    mechanism:
      - "Internal model shifts → brain filters reality differently"
      - "Notice opportunities previously invisible"
      - "Behavior adapts to fulfill predictions"
      - "Nervous system moves toward coherence with imagined state"

    dreamweaving_application: |
      During induction, place listener into theta-dominant predictive plasticity window,
      then introduce future-state identity imprints:
      - "Your mind now recognizes the version of you who has already changed"
      - "Your inner world organizes into the new pattern automatically"

    definition:
      brief: "The brain's reality-selection system that filters what you notice and respond to"
      extended: |
        The RAS is the brain's reality-selection system. Affirmations work not because
        they "magically attract reality," but because they program the RAS to notice
        matching opportunities, filter out contradictory noise, bias attention toward
        confirming evidence, and shift motivation and micro-behaviors.

    functions:
      - "Notice matching opportunities"
      - "Filter out contradictory noise"
      - "Bias attention toward confirming evidence"
      - "Shift motivation and micro-behaviors"

        Neurons fire and wire based on repetition + emotional intensity + imagery.
        Affirmations fail when they conflict with identity. They succeed when embedded
        during hypnotic trance, theta brainwave states, somatic relaxation, and
        emotionally vivid imagery. Dreamweaving creates the exact conditions required.

      extended: |
        The brain cannot distinguish deeply imagined experiences from real ones; it
        stores them as procedural memory and emotional truth. This is used by Olympic
        athletes, PTSD recovery therapies, motor rehabilitation, and elite performers.
        Dreamweavings can create future memories of success.

    applications:
      - "Olympic athlete visualization"

      extended: |
        According to Maxwell Maltz (Psycho-Cybernetics) and modern identity-based
        behavioral science: You never outperform your self-image. You always return
        to the identity your subconscious believes is true. Manifestation is not
        about trying harder—it is about becoming someone for whom the new reality
        is natural.

    core_principle: |
      You never outperform your self-image.
      You always return to the identity your subconscious believes is true.

        Affirmations only work when the body agrees. The body must feel the truth

        In quantum physics, observation collapses a probability field into a definite

        the metaphorical alignment is powerful: You observe a possibility → it becomes
        more real in your psychology → your psychology shapes behavior → your behavior
        shapes matter. Thus attention does create reality, via multi-layered cascades.

      extended: |
        All systems seek resonance. In physics, particles lock in when frequencies
        synchronize. In biology, cells communicate through vibrational signals. In
        psychology, your emotional and mental state acts like a tuning fork. You
        experience the realities that match your dominant internal resonance.

    principle: |
      You experience the realities that match your dominant internal resonance.

        In quantum-adjacent models, all futures already exist as probability-fields.

    definition:
      brief: "Reality as hologram where the whole is contained in each part"
      extended: |
        If reality is holographic (a growing theoretical model), then the whole is
        contained in each part, consciousness is nonlocal, imagery has structural
        power, symbols reorganize perception, and perception reorganizes matter.
        This makes visual imagery an act of field coding.

    principles:
      - "The whole is contained in each part"
      - "Consciousness is nonlocal"
      - "Imagery has structural power"
      - "Symbols reorganize perception"
      - "Perception reorganizes matter"

    dreamweaving_application: |
      Guide users to:
      - Visualize reality as luminous wave patterns
      - Rewrite these patterns
      - Insert new symbols
      - Watch matter coalesce into form
      This turns imagination into energetic architecture.

      Across all esoteric traditions, real-world changes happen when five components align:
      1. Altered State - Trance, meditation, ecstasy, prayer, gnosis, theta
      2. Symbolic Encoding - Sigils, prayers, archetypes, gods, correspondences
      3. Focused Intention - Clear, singular, emotionally charged desire
      4. Energetic Activation - Breath, emotion, visualization, movement, chanting
      5. Identity Shift - Becoming the person for whom the result is natural

    definition:
      brief: "Ceremonial practices that create altered states, symbolic containers, and directed intention"
      extended: |
        Rituals work because they deliberately create liminal space (between worlds),
        altered states of consciousness, focused intention fields, symbolic resonance
        networks, energy-raising and directing mechanisms, and identity shifts through
        invocation and assumption of god-forms.

    definition:
      brief: "Coherence-based field manipulation through surrender, faith, and heart-centered intention"
      extended: |
        Every major religion describes the same mechanisms: deep emotional surrender
        creates coherence, faith creates expectation stability, communal resonance
        amplifies the field, symbol + intention creates reality imprint, and identity
        merger with the Divine increases transformative power.

    mechanisms:
      - "Deep emotional surrender → heart coherence"
      - "Faith → expectation stability"
      - "Communal resonance → amplified field"
      - "Symbol + intention → reality imprint"
      - "Identity merger with Divine → power increase"

    definition:
      brief: "Symbolic encoding, sympathetic magick, and emotional energy projection"
      extended: |
        Witchcraft is fundamentally symbolic encoding (candles, herbs, elements),
        sympathetic magick ("like affects like"), energetic projection (raising and
        directing personal power), trance and visualization, and archetypal partnership
        with nature and spirits.

        Chaos magick strips away religion and dogma, stating: Belief is a tool.
        Use it deliberately. Mechanisms include sigils (compressed intention symbols),
        gnosis states (theta, sexual, ecstatic, breath-induced), belief shifting,

# SECTION 5: FUTURE CONSCIOUSNESS TECHNOLOGIES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

future_technologies:
  entry_id: "psychology.manifestation.future"
  name: "Speculative Future Mind Technologies"

  note: |
    These represent far-future speculative frameworks for consciousness engineering.
    While not currently achievable, they provide powerful imagery and conceptual
    scaffolding for advanced manifestation work.

  consciousness_substrate_interface:
    entry_id: "psychology.manifestation.future.csi"
    name: "Consciousness Substrate Interface (CSI)"

    description: |
      In the far future, mind interacts directly with the underlying computational
      layer of the universe—nonlocal, hyperdimensional, holographic, fractal,
      self-organizing. Thought becomes a programmable instruction set in the
      universal operating system.

    dreamweaving_simulation: |
      Dreamweavings can simulate CSI by guiding users into:
      - Awareness of their own "instruction patterns"
      - Sculpting their inner informational structures
      - Transmitting those structures into the universal field
      - Stabilizing the new configuration

  phase_shift_consciousness:
    entry_id: "psychology.manifestation.future.phase_shift"
    name: "Phase-Shift Consciousness States (PSC)"

    description: |
      Future mind-tech unlocks "Phase States"—modes of consciousness where neural
      activity, electromagnetic fields, quantum bonding, and subjective awareness
      all shift into higher-order coherence, enabling reality editing.

    dreamweaving_application: |
      Guide users to:
      - Drop into a liminal phase
      - Shift the oscillatory pattern of self-awareness
      - Stabilize the phase-state
      - Use it as an engine for reality-sculpting
      Binaural beats and visuals become Phase Induction Tools.

  hyperdimensional_thought_geometry:
    entry_id: "psychology.manifestation.future.geometry"
    name: "Hyperdimensional Thought Geometry"

    description: |
      Future humans visualize intentions not as words, but as geometric structures
      in multidimensional space. These structures encode emotional states, represent
      identity shifts, store probability adjustments, and shape future timelines.

    dreamweaving_application: |
      Include sequences where:
      - User constructs a shape of their desire
      - Structure rotates into higher dimensions
      - It locks into place as a stable attractor
      - Subconscious accepts it as new identity node
      This is Hyperdimensional Sigilcraft.

  fractal_identity_upgrades:
    entry_id: "psychology.manifestation.future.fractal"
    name: "Fractal Identity Upgrades (FIU)"

    description: |
      In the future, identity is fluid and fractal. People upgrade themselves by
      adjusting personality nodes, thought-habits, emotional pathways, behavioral
      attractors. Identity becomes modular, like software.

    dreamweaving_application: |
      Include:
      - Identity fractal exploration
      - Replacing old modules
      - Installing upgraded consciousness patterns
      - Merging with superordinate versions of oneself

  timeline_lattice_navigation:
    entry_id: "psychology.manifestation.future.timeline_lattice"
    name: "Timeline Lattice Navigation (TLN)"

    description: |
      Time is not linear—it is a lattice of potentialities. People learn to
      navigate the probability matrix, tune to preferred outcomes, collapse
      the lattice around their chosen timeline.

    dreamweaving_application: |
      Lead the listener to:
      - Sense multiple future pathways
      - Identify the one matching deepest resonance
      - Align internal field with that timeline
      - "Step into it" through visualization + intention geometry
      This becomes guided destiny selection.

  collective_dreamfield_engineering:
    entry_id: "psychology.manifestation.future.collective"
    name: "Collective Dreamfield Engineering (CDE)"

    description: |
      Civilizations co-create reality by merging dreamfields, linking subconscious
      intent, generating field harmonics, stabilizing shared outcomes. This is
      Collaborative Reality Design.

    dreamweaving_application: |
      Simulate by:
      - Guiding users to imagine joining a collective mind
      - Synchronizing emotional frequencies
      - Merging intention signatures
      - Amplifying manifestation power through collective field

  meta_intention_coding:
    entry_id: "psychology.manifestation.future.meta_intention"
    name: "Meta-Intention Coding (MIC)"

    description: |
      Intention becomes code: executable, modular, stackable, fractalable,
      reconfigurable. People use meta-intentions—core pattern rewrites,
      self-propagating desires, recursive upgrades.

    patterns:
      intention_stacks: "This desire reinforces itself"
      recursive_loops: "Each day I get better automatically"
      self_coding_directives: "My subconscious optimizes me continuously"
      autonomous_agents: "Future version of servitors—helpful thought-entities"

    name: "Holofractal Reality Sculpting (HRS)"

    description: |
      At the furthest edge of mind-tech: Consciousness shapes reality by editing
      the holofractal field beneath spacetime. This is meta-physics in the
      literal sense.

    dreamweaving_application: |
      Journeys can include:
      - Descending into the fundamental lattice of reality
      - Adjusting field nodes
      - Reweaving the fractal pattern
      - Rising back into physical form with the new pattern active
