    tier: 1

    definition:
      brief: "Pre-journey activation of the subconscious image-generation system"
      extended: |
        Imaginal priming prepares the visualization faculty before the main journey
        content arrives. Based on research showing that brief exposure to related
        imagery or concepts increases subsequent visualization vividness and detail.

        The technique involves:
        1. Signaling to the unconscious that detailed imagery is about to be requested
        2. Activating the "render queue" of the imaginal faculty
        3. Establishing expectation of vivid, personal imagery
        4. Creating readiness for spontaneous image emergence

        Psychological basis: Predictive processing theory suggests the brain
        continuously generates predictions. Priming biases these predictions
        toward rich, detailed imagery rather than abstract concepts.

        Key principle: "You are not creating... you are receiving."
        This shifts the listener from active construction (effortful) to
        passive reception (effortless, more vivid).

  DVE-02:

    name: "Hypnagogic Entry"
    tier: 1

    definition:
      brief: "Theta-dominant language patterns for accessing the hypnagogic threshold state"
      extended: |
        The hypnagogic state is the transitional consciousness between waking and
        sleeping where imagery becomes autonomous and vivid. This module uses
        specific language patterns that mimic and induce hypnagogic phenomena:

        Key characteristics to invoke:
        - Phosphene-like visual phenomena (lights, patterns, colors)
        - Spontaneous image formation without effort
        - Sense of witnessing rather than directing
        - Theta brainwave dominance (4-7 Hz)
        - Occasional gamma bursts (insight/clarity moments)

        The language emphasizes passivity, emergence, and surprise rather than
        active construction. Critical phrase: "without you making them."

        Theta-Gamma Coupling: Advanced practitioners may experience "sparks of
        clarity" - gamma bursts that sharpen specific elements within the
        theta-dominant state, producing hyper-vivid focal points.

  # DVE-03: THEATER/TEMPLE CONSTRUCTION
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DVE-03:
    module_id: "DVE-03"
    name: "Theater/Temple Construction"
    tier: 1

    definition:
      brief: "Establishing a stable imaginal container space before journey content"
      extended: |
        Before populating a scene with characters and narrative, establish the
        container space itself. This creates a "meta-space" (temenos) that becomes
        familiar across sessions, deepening with each return.

        Key elements:
        - Architectural stability (walls, ceiling, boundaries)
        - Personal ownership ("your temple", "your theater")
        - Persistent features (altar, screen, doorways)
        - Nested room potential (doors lead to infinite spaces)
        - Sensory richness of the space itself

        Based on Desoille's directed daydream work and Jungian active imagination
        techniques where establishing a "temenos" (sacred container) precedes
        the encounter with unconscious content.

        The container provides:
        1. Psychological safety (bounded space)
        2. Orientation (spatial reference points)
        3. Narrative coherence (events happen "somewhere")
        4. Recursive depth (doors within doors)
        5. Personal meaning (listener's unique version)

        Multiple variants support different journey families:
        - Temple: sacred, initiatory
        - Theater: witnessing, receiving
        - Spaceship: consciousness vehicle, cosmic
        - Garden: paradise, natural wisdom
        - Cave: underworld, shadow work
        - Observatory: celestial, expansive

  DVE-04:

    name: "Embodiment & Proprioception"
    tier: 2

    definition:
      brief: "Deep body awareness including internal organs and imaginal body sensing"
      extended: |
        Beyond basic kinesthetic awareness, this module activates:

        1. Internal body sensing (organs, systems, cellular)
        2. Imaginal body distinct from physical body
        3. Proprioceptive awareness within the visualized space
        4. Felt-sense of the imaginal body moving, breathing, touching

        This deepens embodiment from "imagining seeing" to "being fully present
        in the imaginal body." The listener experiences themselves AS the body
        in the imaginal space, not as a disembodied observer.

        Key techniques:
        - "Look at your hands here" (grounds identity in imaginal body)
        - "Feel the floor beneath your feet" (proprioceptive anchoring)
        - "Sense your heart beating in this chest" (internal awareness)
        - "Your breath moves through these lungs" (somatic integration)

        Psychological basis: Gendlin's Focusing, somatic psychology, polyvagal
        theory, and Tibetan inner heat practices (tummo) all demonstrate that
        body awareness transforms visualization into embodied experience.

        Critical distinction: Physical body relaxes and recedes; imaginal body
        activates and becomes primary. This is not dissociation - it's a
        focused reallocation of attention.

  # DVE-05: AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MIRRORS
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DVE-05:
    module_id: "DVE-05"
    name: "Autonomous Agents & Mirrors"
    tier: 2

    definition:
      brief: "Techniques for entities that move independently and reflective encounters"
      extended: |
        This module provides frameworks for:

        1. Autonomous Agents: Entities that move, speak, and act without narrator
           direction. The listener waits for the entity to act first.
        2. Dialogue Frameworks: Prompts that invite verbal/telepathic exchange.
        3. Mirror Encounters: Meeting reflections that show different self-aspects.
        4. Recursive Depth: Doors within doors, worlds within worlds.

        Key principle: You do NOT control them. They respond, interact, challenge,
        support, and reveal. The unconscious speaks through these figures.

        Based on Jungian active imagination, where the key is allowing figures
        to surprise you rather than directing them. The narrator creates
        the frame ("a figure appears") but the figure's actions/words emerge
        from the listener's unconscious.

        Autonomous agents activate:
        - Unpredictability (surprise = engagement)
        - Symbolic intelligence (unconscious wisdom)
        - Emotional depth (figures carry feeling)
        - Relationship (listener engages, not just receives)

        Mirror encounters provide:
        - Self-reflection without narrator interpretation
        - Identity exploration (who am I here?)
        - Shadow integration (seeing hidden aspects)
        - Future/past self access (temporal mirrors)

      brief: "Techniques to prevent visualization fade and maintain image stability"
      extended: |
        Advanced techniques from lucid dreaming research for maintaining stable,
        vivid imagery when it threatens to fade:

        1. Touch-to-Anchor: Touching objects in the scene increases stability
        2. Hand-Glance: Looking at hands grounds presence in imaginal body
        3. Spinning: Dream stabilization through motion (advanced)
        4. Verbal Declaration: Speaking in the scene reinforces presence
        5. Detail Focus: Zooming into specifics prevents drift
        6. Breath Stabilization: Deep breath in imaginal body anchors presence

        These are "rescue protocols" when visualization becomes unstable, but
        also preventive measures during extended deep visualization.

        Mechanism: Each technique anchors attention to sensory detail, preventing
        the drift toward abstraction or fade-out that occurs when attention
        becomes diffuse. Specific > vague = stable.

  DVE-07:
    module_id: "DVE-07"
    name: "Predictive Processing Override"
    tier: 3

    definition:
      brief: "Impossible imagery and expectation collapse for hyperimaginal states"
      extended: |
        The brain constantly predicts what it will perceive. Introducing impossible
        or expectation-violating imagery collapses these predictions, creating
        openings for novel, breakthrough experiences:

        1. Spatial Impossibilities: Bigger inside than outside, non-Euclidean
        2. Temporal Impossibilities: Time running backwards, simultaneity
        3. Identity Fluidity: Being multiple beings at once
        4. Material Impossibilities: Walking through walls, breathing underwater
        5. Perspective Shifts: Seeing from multiple vantage points simultaneously
        6. Logical Contradictions: Being here and there, self and other

        Mechanism: When predictions fail, the brain enters a more receptive,
        less filtered state. This creates openings for experiences that cannot
        be constructed by normal cognition - genuine "impossible" experiences
        that transcend ordinary consciousness.

        This is the most advanced DVE module and should only be used with
        experienced practitioners who have developed stable imaginal capacity.

        Warning: These experiences can be destabilizing for unprepared listeners.
        Always ensure strong grounding before and after.
