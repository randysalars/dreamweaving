# Scene Architecture Framework
# Defines spatial layering, visual composition, and depth staging for Dreamweaving visualizations
# Version: 1.0
# Created: 2025-12-09

version: "1.0"
created: "2025-12-09"
purpose: "Scene architecture and spatial composition guidelines for Dreamweaving visualizations"

# ============================================================================
# OVERVIEW
# ============================================================================
#
# This framework defines how visual scenes are spatially organized in
# Dreamweaving sessions. Based on cinematic composition, art theory, and
# visualization research.
#
# Key concepts:
# - Three-layer depth (foreground, midground, background)
# - Focal point hierarchy
# - Scene transition types
# - Lighting and atmosphere
# - Spatial anchoring for stabilization
