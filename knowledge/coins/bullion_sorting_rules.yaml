  Fast, practical methodology for sorting silver coins into
  bullion-grade (sell fast) vs numismatic (sell later) categories.
  The core truth: You are not selling coins. You are selling liquidity.

# =============================================================================
# THE MASTER RULE
# =============================================================================
master_rule:
  statement: "You are not selling coins. You are selling liquidity."
  every_decision_answers: "Will this move in days, not months?"

# =============================================================================
# BUYER FRICTION HIERARCHY
# =============================================================================
friction_levels:
  ultra_low:
    description: "Sell FIRST - fastest cash flow"
    items:
      - "1 oz government bullion (ASE, Maple, Britannia, Philharmonic)"
      - "Generic 1 oz rounds"
      - "10 oz bars (recognized mints)"
      - "Pre-1965 U.S. junk silver (90%)"

  medium:
    description: "Sell SECOND"
    items:
      - "Proofs (modern)"
      - "Branded rounds"
      - "Semi-numismatic bullion"

  high:
    description: "WAIT - don't lead with these"
    items:
      - "Rare dates"
      - "Heavily graded numismatics"
      - "Odd weights / obscure mints"
      - "Slabbed coins"
      - "Varieties / errors"

  rule: "Cash flow comes from ultra-low friction, not high friction"

    note: "P mint only for 1927 - D is semi-key"

# =============================================================================
# "LOOKS TOO NICE" RULE
# =============================================================================
looks_too_nice:
  description: "If any of these apply, it is NOT bullion-grade"
  pull_if:
    - "Strong cartwheel luster"
    - "Looks AU or better"
    - "Clean fields"

# FAST TRIAGE METHOD (3 STEPS)
# =============================================================================
triage_method:
  step_1:
    name: "Sort by date/mint ONLY (no grading yet)"
    create_piles:
      pile_1: "Safe dates"
      pile_2: "Questionable"
      pile_3: "Stop immediately (key/semi-key)"

  step_2:
    name: "Condition sweep"
    from_pile: "Safe dates"
    remove_if:
      - "Shiny"
      - "Lightly worn"
      - "Attractive"

  step_3:
    name: "Final bullion pile"
    what_remains:
      - "Flat detail"
      - "Gray patina"
      - "Honest wear"
    result: "This pile is safe to sell fast"
