  The most liquid form of small-denomination silver on earth.
  Junk silver = U.S. coins minted for circulation that contain 90% silver
  and carry no collector premium. Called "junk" because condition doesn't
  matter, dates usually don't matter - traded by face value, not rarity.

# SILVER CONTENT MATH (MEMORIZE THIS)
# =============================================================================
silver_math:
  per_dollar_fv:
    silver_oz: 0.715
    note: "Worn coins still average very close to this"
    examples:
      - fv: 1
        silver_oz: 0.715
      - fv: 10
        silver_oz: 7.15
      - fv: 100
        silver_oz: 71.5

  pricing_formula:
    formula: "Face Value × Multiplier"
    example: "If multiplier is 20× and you have $10 FV, price = $200"

  multiplier_guide:
    low: 18
    typical: 20
    high: 22
    note: "Varies with spot price and market conditions"

# WHY JUNK SILVER IS KING
# =============================================================================
advantages:
  vs_rounds_bars:
    - "Instantly recognizable"
    - "Fractional by nature"
    - "No assays needed"
    - "Trusted by average people"

  vs_silver_dollars:
    - "Easier to trade"
    - "Smaller increments"
    - "Lower single-item risk"
    - "Better for barter logic"

  who_loves_it:
    - "Preppers"
    - "Dealers"
    - "Repeat buyers"

# =============================================================================
# SORTING RULES
# =============================================================================
sorting:
  step_1:
    action: "Separate by denomination"
    create_piles:
      - dimes
      - quarters
      - halves
    note: "Never sell mixed piles unless intentional"

  step_2:
    action: "Pull anything that is NOT junk"
    remove:
      - "Slick key-date coins (rare but possible)"
      - "Proofs"
      - "Damaged/holed coins (sell separately)"
      - "40% halves (1965-1970 Kennedy)"

  step_3:
    action: "Decide your 'barter fraction'"
    common_strategy:
      sell: ["quarters", "halves"]
      keep: ["dimes"]
      reason: "Dimes are most practical unit in disruption scenarios"

  cherry_picking:
    rule: "DO NOT cherry-pick dates"
    reason: "Cherry-picking kills trust"
    buyer_expectation: "randomness, honesty, average wear"
