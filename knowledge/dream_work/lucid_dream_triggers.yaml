overview:
  name: "Lucid Dream Triggers"

  definition:
    brief: "Techniques to induce conscious awareness within dream-like altered states"
    extended: |
      Lucid dreaming is the state of being aware that one is dreaming while
      the dream continues. In Dreamweaving, we adapt lucid dream induction
      techniques to help listeners recognize they are in a special state
      while maintaining immersion. This creates a unique blend of conscious
      participation and deep trance experience.

      The goal is not to wake the listener from trance, but to give them
      a sense of agency and co-creation within the journey space.

  relevance_to_dreamweaving: |
    Lucid dream techniques enhance Dreamweaving by:
    - Giving listeners sense of agency and choice
    - Deepening engagement through active participation
    - Creating memorable, transformative experiences
    - Allowing conscious interaction with journey elements
    - Supporting integration by maintaining witness awareness

  core_principles:
    - "Awareness enhances, not interrupts, the experience"
    - "Recognition leads to deeper engagement"
    - "Agency within the journey accelerates transformation"
    - "Dream logic remains valid even with awareness"
    - "The observer and the observed become one"
