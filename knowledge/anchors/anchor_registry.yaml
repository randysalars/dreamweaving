      brief: "Extended exhale activates parasympathetic response for instant calm"
      extended: |
        The extended exhale pattern directly stimulates the vagus nerve,
        shifting the nervous system from sympathetic to parasympathetic
        dominance. By making this breath deliberate and associated with
        a calm state, it becomes a reliable anchor for instant calm access
        in any situation.
