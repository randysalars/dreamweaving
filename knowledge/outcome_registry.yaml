# OUTCOME REGISTRY - Outcome Engineering Framework
# =============================================================================
# Central registry mapping desired outcomes to required patterns, archetypes,

#
# Usage: Consult this registry when designing sessions to ensure all required
# components are included for the stated outcome.

# Each outcome category defines what patterns, archetypes, objects, and actions
