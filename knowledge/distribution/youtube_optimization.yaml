    category selection, algorithmic positioning, niche clustering, metadata
    optimization, and audience targeting. Based on expert analysis of the
    meditation/hypnosis/spiritual content vertical.

    Dreamweaving content combines guided hypnosis, spiritual pathworking, visual
    storytelling, archetypal encounters, and consciousness expansion. These hybrid

    YouTube's broad spiritual/meditation container with optimal clustering.

# SECTION 1: CATEGORY SELECTION
# =============================================================================

category_selection:

  optimal_category:
    entry_id: "distribution.youtube.category_selection"
    name: "Optimal YouTube Category for Dreamweaving"
    domain: distribution
    category: youtube_optimization

    definition:
      brief: "People & Blogs is the optimal YouTube category for Dreamweaving hypnotic journeys"
      extended: |
        The "People & Blogs" category is algorithmically ideal for Dreamweaving content
        because it serves as YouTube's broad spiritual/meditation container. The platform
        naturally clusters guided meditations, hypnosis sessions, spiritual journeys,
        binaural beat immersive sessions, manifestation content, shamanic journeys,
        astral travel experiences, healing visualizations, and energy activation videos
        in this category. This provides the widest reach, best algorithmic adjacency,
        and highest retention expectations for 20-60 minute immersive sessions.

    recommendation: "People & Blogs"

    rationale:
      intent_alignment: |
        The platform treats meditation-style content as personal transformation, which
        sits under the digital umbrella of personal expression → People & Blogs.
        Dreamweavings lean heavily into inner journeys, archetypal conversations,
        healing visualizations, spiritual expansion, and consciousness techniques.
        This IS personal transformation — YouTube's system maps it here.

      niche_clustering: |
        Content will be clustered alongside meditation channels, spiritual awakening
        channels, shamanic journey creators, frequency/healing sound creators, and
        manifestation/quantum reality creators. This increases suggested video
        placement, browsing impressions, spiritual audience reach, and watch-history
        match rates.

      retention_modeling: |
        People & Blogs has the highest retention expectations for long-form
        transformational content. The algorithm expects and rewards 20-60 minute
        immersive sessions — exactly what Dreamweavings deliver.

      feeling_based_formats: |
        YouTube's recommendation engine treats People & Blogs content as emotional,
        transformational, story-driven, and personal experience focused.
        Dreamweavings are precisely this.

    benefits:
      - "Algorithmic reach maximization"
      - "Spiritual niche clustering"
      - "Long-session retention matching"
      - "Search relevance optimization"
      - "Suggested-video traffic increase"
      - "Channel authority in unified niche"

  category_alternatives:

    name: "Why Other Categories Are Suboptimal"
    domain: distribution
    category: youtube_optimization

    definition:
      brief: "Music, Education, and Entertainment categories reduce visibility for Dreamweaving content"

    music_category:
      recommendation: "AVOID"
      problems:
        - "Dramatically lowers CTR expectations"
        - "Reduces retention modeling accuracy"
        - "Decreases search presence"
        - "Misaligns suggested-video matching"
        - "Optimized for songs, not guided journeys"
      note: |
        Many creators mistakenly choose Music thinking binaural beats = music.
        This is a significant strategic error that limits algorithmic performance.

    education_category:
      recommendation: "AVOID"
      problems:
        - "Expects tutorial structure"
        - "Expects explanations and instructional pacing"
        - "Misaligns with experiential content"
      note: |
        Although Dreamweavings are deeply educational spiritually, the Education
        category expects instructional format. Dreamweaving content is experiential,
        not instructional — causing misalignment.

    entertainment_category:
      recommendation: "AVOID"
      problems:
        - "Wrong audience intent signals"
        - "Competes with entertainment-focused content"
        - "Mismatched retention expectations"
      note: |
        Entertainment expects different engagement patterns and audience behaviors
        than transformational meditation content.
