overview:
  definition:
    brief: "Ritual speech acts that establish sacred space and invite supportive presence"
    extended: |
      Invocation is the practice of calling in - calling sacred space into being,
      calling supportive presences to witness or guide, calling forth the highest
      aspects of self. Unlike evocation (calling something external), invocation
      opens an inner doorway. In hypnotic work, invocations create the psychological
      container for transformation by signaling to the unconscious that something
      sacred is about to occur.
    essence: "Opening the door between worlds"

  function_in_dreamweaving: |
    - Establish psychological boundary of sacred space
    - Signal to unconscious that transformation is invited
    - Create permission structure for deep work
    - Invoke supportive inner resources
    - Set tone and intention for the journey

  placement: "Pre-talk or early induction"

  caution: |
    Invocations should match the listener's spiritual framework or be
    spiritually neutral. Avoid imposing specific religious content unless
    the session is explicitly framed within that tradition.
