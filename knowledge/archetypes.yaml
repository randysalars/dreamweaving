  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # USAGE GUIDELINES
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  usage_guidelines:
    selection: >
      1. Identify the core emotional theme of the journey
      2. Match to 1-2 relevant archetypes from the list
      3. Use the shadow aspect to name what the listener may be experiencing
      4. Use the transformation template at the journey peak (helm)
      5. Reference the gift in the integration section

    integration: >
      After the transformation moment, always ground the gift:
      - "And you carry this knowing with you now..."
      - "This truth lives in you..."
      - "Whenever you need to remember..."

    safety: >
      Shadow work can be intense. Always:
      - Establish safety in pre-talk
      - Move gently into shadow content
      - Ensure transformation happens (never leave in shadow)
      - Ground thoroughly in integration and closing
      - Use breath anchors to stabilize
