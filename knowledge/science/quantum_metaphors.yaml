# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================

overview:
  name: "Quantum Metaphors"

  definition:
    brief: "Scientific concepts from quantum physics used as transformative metaphors"
    extended: |
      Quantum physics reveals a reality fundamentally different from our
      everyday experience - where observation affects what is observed,
      where particles exist in multiple states until measured, where
      everything is connected across space and time. These concepts,
      used as metaphors (not literal claims), provide powerful images
      for transformation, consciousness, and the participatory nature
      of reality.

  important_note: |
    These are METAPHORS, not scientific claims. Quantum physics is often
    misrepresented in spiritual contexts. We use these concepts poetically
    to illuminate psychological and spiritual truths, not to make claims
    about physics. The listener's unconscious responds to the imagery
    regardless of the literal science.

  relevance_to_dreamweaving: |
    Quantum metaphors serve Dreamweaving by:
    - Providing modern, culturally resonant imagery
    - Suggesting participation in creating reality
    - Offering transformation through observation/awareness
    - Connecting to scientific-minded listeners
    - Bridging science and spirit poetically

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # THE OBSERVER EFFECT
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  observer_effect:
    entry_id: "science.quantum.observer_effect"
    name: "The Observer Effect"

    science:
      brief: "The act of observation affects what is observed"
      description: |
        In quantum mechanics, measuring a particle's properties can
        change those properties. The famous double-slit experiment
        shows particles behaving as waves until observed, when they
        collapse into particle behavior.

    metaphor:
      brief: "Awareness itself transforms what it touches"
      description: |
        As a metaphor, this suggests that consciousness is not passive
        but participatory. By observing your thoughts, emotions, or
        patterns, you change them. Awareness is transformative.

    psychology:
      themes:
        - Awareness transforms experience
        - Witnessing changes what is witnessed
        - Consciousness is participatory
        - Attention shapes reality

    journey_applications:

      outcome_alignment: ["self_knowledge", "transformation", "healing"]
      when_to_use:
        - "Bringing awareness to patterns"
        - "Transformation through witnessing"
        - "Understanding how attention works"

  # SUPERPOSITION
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  superposition:
    entry_id: "science.quantum.superposition"
    name: "Quantum Superposition"

    science:
      brief: "Particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured"
      description: |
        Before measurement, a quantum particle exists in a superposition
        of all possible states. Schrödinger's famous thought experiment
        imagined a cat both alive and dead until observed. Only upon
        observation does the particle "collapse" into one definite state.

    metaphor:
      brief: "Multiple possibilities exist until you choose/observe"
      description: |
        As metaphor, this suggests that the future is not fixed but
        exists as multiple potentials. Your choices, attention, and
        consciousness "collapse" possibility into actuality. The self
        holds multiple versions until one is chosen.

    psychology:
      themes:
        - Multiple possibilities exist simultaneously
        - Choice collapses potential into actual
        - The future is not determined
        - Identity is fluid until observed

  # WAVE-PARTICLE DUALITY
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  wave_particle_duality:
    entry_id: "science.quantum.wave_particle"
    name: "Wave-Particle Duality"

    science:
      brief: "Quantum entities behave as both waves and particles"
      description: |
        Light and matter exhibit properties of both waves (spread out,
        interfering) and particles (localized, discrete). They are neither
        strictly one nor the other, but something that transcends both
        categories.

    metaphor:
      brief: "We are both individual and connected, localized and infinite"
      description: |
        As metaphor, this points to the dual nature of self - both a
        localized individual (particle) and connected to everything
        (wave). We are simultaneously a unique point of consciousness
        and an expression of the universal field.

    psychology:
      themes:
        - Individual yet connected
        - Both local and non-local
        - Transcending either/or thinking
        - Union of opposites

    journey_applications:
      phase_alignment: ["helm_deep_trance", "integration"]
      outcome_alignment: ["spiritual_growth", "self_knowledge"]
      when_to_use:

  # QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  entanglement:
    entry_id: "science.quantum.entanglement"
    name: "Quantum Entanglement"

    science:
      brief: "Particles can be correlated across any distance instantaneously"
      description: |
        Entangled particles maintain correlated states regardless of
        distance. Measuring one instantly affects the other, even at
        opposite ends of the universe. Einstein called this "spooky
        action at a distance."

    metaphor:
      brief: "We are connected to everything, affecting and affected across space"
      description: |
        As metaphor, entanglement suggests that connection transcends
        physical distance. Our thoughts, intentions, and states may
        influence and be influenced by those we're connected to,
        regardless of physical separation.

    psychology:
      themes:
        - Deep interconnection
        - Non-local connection
        - Relationships transcend distance
        - Affecting and being affected

    journey_applications:
      phase_alignment: ["journey", "helm_deep_trance"]
      outcome_alignment: ["healing", "spiritual_growth"]
      when_to_use:
        - "Connection to loved ones (living or passed)"
        - "Healing relationships at a distance"

  # THE QUANTUM FIELD
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  quantum_field:
    entry_id: "science.quantum.field"
    name: "The Quantum Field"

    science:
      brief: "All particles are excitations of underlying quantum fields"
      description: |
        Quantum field theory describes particles not as fundamental
        objects but as excitations or vibrations of underlying fields
        that pervade all of space. The electron field, for example,
        exists everywhere - electrons are where that field is excited.

    metaphor:
      brief: "We are waves in an infinite ocean of consciousness/energy"
      description: |
        As metaphor, the quantum field suggests that we are not
        separate objects but expressions of an underlying unified
        field of consciousness or energy. We are waves in an
        infinite ocean, temporarily distinct but never separate.

    psychology:
      themes:
        - Underlying unity
        - We are expressions of something greater
        - Connection to the source
        - Individual as universal

  # QUANTUM VACUUM / ZERO POINT
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  quantum_vacuum:
    entry_id: "science.quantum.vacuum"
    name: "Quantum Vacuum / Zero Point Energy"

    science:
      brief: "Empty space is actually full of potential energy and virtual particles"
      description: |
        The quantum vacuum is not truly empty but seethes with
        virtual particle pairs constantly appearing and disappearing.
        Zero-point energy is the baseline energy that exists even
        in the vacuum of space.

    metaphor:
      brief: "Emptiness is pregnant with possibility; stillness is alive"
      description: |
        As metaphor, this suggests that apparent emptiness or
        stillness is actually full of potential. The void is not
        dead but alive with possibility. Rest and silence are
        not absence but presence in potential form.

    psychology:
      themes:
        - Emptiness is pregnant with possibility
        - Stillness is alive
        - Potential in the void
        - Rest as generative

      description: |
        A laser produces light where all waves are in phase (coherent),
        making it extraordinarily powerful compared to ordinary light.
        As metaphor: alignment of intention, thought, and energy
        creates extraordinary power.

      brief: "When frequencies match, energy transfers powerfully"
      description: |
        Resonance occurs when an object vibrates at its natural
        frequency, causing maximum energy transfer. As metaphor:
        when we align with our true nature, we receive maximum
