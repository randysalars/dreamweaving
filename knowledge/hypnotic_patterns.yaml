    1. Use maximum 2 nondual pointers per session
    2. Place in deepest trance states (helm or deep integration)

    5. Don't explain or interpret - let the pointer do the work
    6. Best for spiritual_growth and self_knowledge outcomes

  safety_note: >
    Nondual experiences can be disorienting. Always ensure:
    - Strong grounding in pre-talk and reorientation
    - Clear return path established
    - Listener has established trance relationship first
    - Not overused (can become conceptual rather than direct)

submodality_shifts:
  description: >
    NLP submodality shifts transform mental representations by altering their
    sensory qualities. This creates immediate changes in emotional meaning
    and nervous system responses. Extremely powerful for anxiety reduction,
    trauma softening, confidence building, and releasing shame/guilt.

    Submodalities are the building blocks of internal experience:
    - Visual: brightness, size, distance, color, focus, movement

    Safely update emotional tone of memories. Based on memory reconsolidation
    science - when memories are retrieved in a safe state, they become
    temporarily malleable and can be updated with new emotional context.
    This is the "light" version for mild-moderate content only.

    When a memory is recalled, it enters a "reconsolidation window" where
    its emotional charge can be updated before being re-stored. By recalling
    in a safe, resourced state, we can soften the emotional intensity
    without changing the factual content.

      series:

        episode: 2
        total_episodes: 5
        previous_session: "garden-of-eden-awakening"
        callbacks:
          - symbol: "golden fruit"
            status: "received"
          - location: "Tree of Life"

          next_state: "flowering"

  usage_guidelines: >
    1. Plan the full arc before creating episode 1
    2. Document symbols, locations, and guides consistently
    3. Reference previous sessions explicitly
    4. Track symbol evolution in manifest
    5. Each episode should stand alone but reward serial listening
    6. Final episode should bring full integration
