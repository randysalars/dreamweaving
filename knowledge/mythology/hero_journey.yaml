  definition:
    brief: "Universal narrative pattern of departure, initiation, and return"
    extended: |
      The Hero's Journey is a template for transformational narratives found
      across all cultures and times. It describes the pattern of leaving the
      ordinary world, facing trials and transformation in a special world,
      and returning with gifts or wisdom. In hypnotic work, this structure
      provides a container for psychological transformation that feels
      archetypal and meaningful to the listener.
    essence: "The eternal pattern of transformation through ordeal"

  three_acts:
    departure: "Separation from the ordinary world"
    initiation: "Trials and transformation in the special world"
    return: "Integration and bringing gifts back"

  dreamweaving_application: |
    The Hero's Journey maps naturally to hypnotic session structure:
    - Departure = Pre-talk and Induction (leaving waking consciousness)
    - Initiation = Journey and Helm (deep trance transformation)
    - Return = Integration and Reorientation (bringing gifts back)

# =============================================================================
# ACT I: DEPARTURE

    name: "The Ordinary World"
    stage_number: 1
    act: "departure"

    definition:
      brief: "The hero's normal life before the adventure begins"
      extended: |
        The Ordinary World establishes the baseline - who the hero is before
        transformation. It shows limitations, unfulfilled desires, and the
        status quo that will be disrupted. In hypnotic work, this corresponds
        to acknowledging where the listener currently is before guiding them
        to change.

    journey_phase: "pre_talk"
    purpose: "Establish rapport, acknowledge current state, create contrast"

    psychological_function: |
      - Validate the listener's current experience
      - Create the "before" snapshot for transformation
      - Surface dissatisfaction that motivates change
      - Establish safety before departure

    name: "The Call to Adventure"
    stage_number: 2
    act: "departure"

    definition:
      brief: "The invitation or challenge that begins the journey"
      extended: |
        Something disrupts the ordinary world - a challenge, invitation,
        crisis, or opportunity that demands response. The call represents
        the moment when staying the same becomes more painful than changing.
        In hypnotic work, this is framing the session's purpose and
        inviting the listener into transformation.

    journey_phase: "pre_talk"
    purpose: "Present the opportunity for transformation"

    psychological_function: |
      - Articulate what change is possible
      - Create desire and motivation
      - Frame the session's transformational intent
      - Invite conscious participation

    name: "Refusal of the Call"
    stage_number: 3
    act: "departure"

    definition:
      brief: "Hesitation, doubt, or resistance before committing"
      extended: |
        The hero initially refuses or hesitates - fear of the unknown,
        attachment to the familiar, doubt about worthiness. This resistance
        is natural and must be honored. In hypnotic work, acknowledging
        resistance actually reduces it, and validates the listener's
        protective parts.

    journey_phase: "pre_talk"
    purpose: "Acknowledge and dissolve resistance"

    psychological_function: |
      - Validate protective hesitation
      - Name fears to reduce their power
      - Create permission for resistance
      - Paradoxically increase readiness

    definition:
      brief: "Encounter with a guide who provides wisdom, tools, or encouragement"
      extended: |
        The mentor is a figure of wisdom who has walked this path before.
        They provide guidance, tools, or simply the encouragement needed
        to proceed. In hypnotic work, the narrator serves as mentor,
        and inner guides may also appear. The mentor represents the
        part of self that already knows the way.

    journey_phase: "induction"
    purpose: "Establish guidance and safety for the journey"

    psychological_function: |
      - Provide trusted guidance
      - Gift tools or resources for the journey
      - Embody the wisdom the listener will discover
      - Create secure attachment for deep work

    definition:
      brief: "Leaving the ordinary world and entering the special world"
      extended: |
        The hero commits to the adventure by crossing from the known into
        the unknown. There is no going back - a point of no return. In
        hypnotic work, this is the moment of entering trance, leaving
        waking consciousness for the journey state. It should feel
        significant and intentional.

    journey_phase: "induction"
    purpose: "Mark the transition into trance state"

    psychological_function: |
      - Create clear demarcation between states
      - Commit to the journey
      - Leave ordinary mind behind
      - Enter receptive, open state

    definition:
      brief: "The hero learns the rules of the special world through challenges"
      extended: |
        In the special world, the hero faces tests that reveal strengths
        and weaknesses, meets allies who aid the journey, and encounters
        enemies or obstacles. These experiences prepare for the central
        ordeal. In hypnotic work, this is the deepening phase where
        resistance dissolves and resources emerge.

      extended: |
        The hero approaches the place of greatest danger - the dragon's lair,
        the innermost sanctum. This is the approach to the core wound,
        the deepest fear, the thing that must be faced. Tension builds.
        In hypnotic work, this is approaching the helm section where
        the deepest transformation occurs.

    psychological_function: |

      extended: |
        This is the supreme ordeal - the hero faces their greatest fear,
        confronts death (literal or symbolic), and experiences transformation.
        Something must die for something new to be born. In hypnotic work,
        this is the helm section, the deepest point of trance where
        the core transformation occurs.

      extended: |
        Having survived the ordeal, the hero claims the reward - the
        treasure, elixir, or gift that was the goal of the quest. This
        might be insight, healing, power, or reconciliation. In hypnotic
        work, this is the moment of receiving the transformation's gift.

    journey_phase: "helm_deep_trance"

        The hero must return to the ordinary world, but the journey back
        is not simply retracing steps. The hero is changed, and the return
        brings its own challenges. In hypnotic work, this is the beginning
        of integration and the gradual return from deep trance.

        The transformation must be demonstrated. In hypnotic work, this

        The journey is complete only when the gift is shared. In hypnotic
