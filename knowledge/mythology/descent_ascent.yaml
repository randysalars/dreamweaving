overview:
  name: "Descent & Ascent (Katabasis & Anabasis)"

  definition:
    brief: "The mythological pattern of journeying to the underworld and returning transformed"
    extended: |
      The descent to the underworld (katabasis) and return (anabasis) is
      one of the most universal mythological patterns across human cultures.
      From Inanna to Orpheus, Persephone to Jesus, Dante to Odin, heroes
      and goddesses descend into darkness, face trials, and return with
      gifts or knowledge. This pattern maps the psychological journey of
      confronting shadow, integrating lost parts, processing grief, and
      emerging transformed.

  key_examples:
    - name: "Inanna's Descent"
      culture: "Sumerian"
      theme: "Stripping of identity, death and rebirth"

    - name: "Persephone"
      culture: "Greek"
      theme: "Abduction, integration of dark and light"

    - name: "Orpheus and Eurydice"
      culture: "Greek"
      theme: "Love, loss, the danger of looking back"

    - name: "Dante's Inferno"
      culture: "Medieval Christian"
      theme: "Journey through hell toward paradise"

    - name: "Christ's Harrowing of Hell"
      culture: "Christian"
      theme: "Descent to free captive souls"

    - name: "Odin at the Well"
      culture: "Norse"
      theme: "Sacrifice for wisdom"

    - name: "Jonah in the Whale"
      culture: "Hebrew"
      theme: "Swallowed by darkness, spit back transformed"

  psychological_meaning: |
    The descent represents confrontation with:
    - The shadow (rejected aspects of self)
    - Grief and loss
    - Fear of death/endings
    - The unconscious depths
    - Buried trauma or pain

    The ascent represents:
    - Integration of what was found
    - Resurrection/renewal
    - Return with gifts/wisdom
    - Completion of transformation

  relevance_to_dreamweaving: |
    Descent/ascent patterns provide:
    - Structure for deep shadow work
    - Framework for grief processing
    - Template for transformation journeys
    - Mythic container for difficult material
    - Balance of darkness and return to light

      Something calls the journeyer downward - grief, curiosity, necessity,
      or the loss of something precious. The descent is never casual; there
      is always a reason compelling enough to enter the darkness.

    common_catalysts:
      - "Loss of a loved one"
      - "Personal crisis or breakdown"
      - "Something precious taken below"

      This threshold is often guarded and requires something to cross -
      payment, password, or sacrifice. The crossing is one-way at first;

      As the journeyer descends, they are stripped of their identity,
      possessions, and defenses. Like Inanna passing through seven gates,
      each layer is removed until nothing remains. This is symbolic death -
      the ego dismembered, the false self dissolved.

    forms_of_stripping:
      - "Gates that remove possessions/symbols"
      - "Dismemberment (shamanic death)"
      - "Dissolution, melting, burning"
      - "Loss of identity markers"
      - "Forgetting who you were"
      - "Humiliation, exposure"

      Inanna passes through seven gates, at each removing:

      4. Breastplate (protection)
      5. Gold ring (personal power)
