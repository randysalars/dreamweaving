  definition:
    brief: "Jewish mystical tradition mapping creation, consciousness, and divine emanation through the Tree of Life"
    extended: |
      Qabalah is a mystical and esoteric tradition originating in Jewish mysticism,
      later adapted by Western occultists. Its central symbol, the Tree of Life
      (Etz Chaim), maps the process of divine creation through ten spheres
      (sephiroth) connected by twenty-two paths. Each sephira represents a
      divine attribute, a level of consciousness, and a stage of manifestation.

      The Tree provides:
      - A map of consciousness from pure spirit to physical matter
      - A framework for understanding psychological and spiritual development
      - Rich correspondences (colors, planets, elements, tarot, etc.)
      - Pathways for ascent (return to source) and descent (manifestation)

  core_texts:
    - name: "Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Formation)"
      description: "Early text on Hebrew letters and creation"
    - name: "Zohar (Book of Splendor)"
      description: "Central text of Jewish Kabbalah"
    - name: "The Mystical Qabalah"
      author: "Dion Fortune"
      description: "Western esoteric interpretation"

  relevance_to_dreamweaving: |
    The Tree of Life provides an exceptionally rich framework for journey design:
    - Each sephira offers distinct themes, imagery, and transformations
    - Paths between sephiroth structure transitions and initiations
    - Correspondences ensure symbolic coherence across audio/visual/narrative
    - The descent/ascent structure maps naturally to journey phases
    - Psychological interpretations support therapeutic applications
