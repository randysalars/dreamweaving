overview:
  name: "Hermeticism"
  source: "Corpus Hermeticum, Emerald Tablet, Kybalion"

  definition:
    brief: "Ancient philosophical and spiritual tradition based on the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus"
    extended: |
      Hermeticism is a spiritual, philosophical, and magical tradition based on
      writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus ("Thrice-Great Hermes"),
      a syncretism of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth.
      The tradition encompasses cosmology, alchemy, astrology, and theurgy,
      united by the principle "As above, so below" - the correspondence
      between macrocosm and microcosm.
    essence: "The universe and the self are mirrors of each other"

      description: "1908 text articulating Seven Hermetic Principles"

  relevance_to_dreamweaving: |
    Hermetic principles provide a philosophical framework for understanding
    how hypnotic transformation works. The principle of correspondence
    explains why symbolic work creates real change; the principle of
    mentalism explains why mind can reshape experience; the principle
    of vibration explains brainwave entrainment and tonal effects.

# THE SEVEN HERMETIC PRINCIPLES
# =============================================================================

seven_principles:

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1. THE PRINCIPLE OF MENTALISM
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mentalism:
    entry_id: "traditions.hermeticism.mentalism"
    name: "The Principle of Mentalism"
    number: 1

    definition:
      brief: "THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is Mental"
      extended: |
        The foundational principle - consciousness is primary, matter is
        secondary. The universe exists within the mind of THE ALL, and
        all creation is mental in nature. This explains why mental/imaginal
        work can create real transformation - mind shapes reality.

    axiom: "THE ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental."

    implications:
      - Reality is fundamentally consciousness-based
      - Mental states create physical conditions
      - Imagination is a creative power
      - Thought precedes manifestation
      - Inner work creates outer change

    applications_to_dreamweaving:
      - Visualization creates real neurological change
      - Imaginal experiences shape beliefs and behavior
      - The journey space is as real as waking reality
      - Mental rehearsal builds capacity

        </prosody>

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2. THE PRINCIPLE OF CORRESPONDENCE
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  correspondence:
    entry_id: "traditions.hermeticism.correspondence"
    name: "The Principle of Correspondence"
    number: 2

    definition:
      brief: "As above, so below; as below, so above"
      extended: |
        There is correspondence between all planes of existence - the
        physical, mental, and spiritual mirror each other. What happens
        on one level reflects on others. The microcosm (individual)
        mirrors the macrocosm (universe). This is why symbolic work
        is effective - symbols correspond to realities.

    axiom: "As above, so below; as below, so above."

    implications:
      - Symbolic work creates real change
      - Individual transformation reflects universal patterns
      - The body mirrors the mind; the mind mirrors the cosmos
      - Archetypal symbols access universal truths
      - Personal healing participates in cosmic healing

    applications_to_dreamweaving:
      - Journey imagery corresponds to psychological reality
      - Working with archetypes accesses universal patterns
      - Symbolic transformation creates actual transformation
      - The special world mirrors the ordinary world

  # 3. THE PRINCIPLE OF VIBRATION
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  vibration:
    entry_id: "traditions.hermeticism.vibration"
    name: "The Principle of Vibration"
    number: 3

    definition:
      brief: "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates"
      extended: |
        Everything is in constant motion and vibration. The differences
        between matter, energy, mind, and spirit are differences in
        rate of vibration. Higher vibrations correspond to higher states
        of consciousness. This explains why sound, rhythm, and frequency
        affect consciousness.

    axiom: "Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."

    implications:
      - States of consciousness are vibrational states
      - Sound and frequency influence mind and body
      - Entrainment is possible through resonance
      - Raising vibration raises consciousness
      - Dense states can be transmuted to lighter ones

    applications_to_dreamweaving:
      - Binaural beats work through vibration entrainment
      - Voice tone carries vibrational information
      - Sound design creates energetic environment
      - Rhythm induces trance states
      - Brainwave states are vibrational patterns

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 4. THE PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  polarity:
    entry_id: "traditions.hermeticism.polarity"
    name: "The Principle of Polarity"
    number: 4

    definition:
      brief: "Everything is dual; opposites are identical in nature, different in degree"
      extended: |
        Everything has its pair of opposites - hot and cold, light and dark,
        love and hate. But these are not absolute opposites; they are
        the same thing at different degrees on a spectrum. This allows
        for transmutation - moving along the spectrum from one pole
        toward the other.

    axiom: "Everything is Dual; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree."

    implications:
      - Shadow and gift are poles of the same spectrum
      - Fear and love are degrees of the same emotion
      - Transformation is movement along the polarity spectrum
      - Integration unites polarities
      - No quality is absolute; all can be transmuted

    applications_to_dreamweaving:
      - Shadow integration moves along polarity spectrum
      - Transformation shifts position between poles
      - Emotional alchemy transmutes negative to positive
      - Opposites can be reconciled through understanding
      - Healing is often movement toward the opposite pole

    templates:
      ssml_principle: |
        <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
        And what you felt as darkness...<break time="2.5s"/>
        you begin to recognize...<break time="2s"/>

        the same energy...<break time="2s"/>
        waiting to transform...<break time="3s"/>
        </prosody>

    shadow_gift_connection: |
      The Principle of Polarity is the foundation of shadow/gift work.
      Each shadow quality has its corresponding gift at the other pole.
      Transformation doesn't eliminate the energy but redirects it.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 5. THE PRINCIPLE OF RHYTHM
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  rhythm:
    entry_id: "traditions.hermeticism.rhythm"
    name: "The Principle of Rhythm"
    number: 5

    definition:
      brief: "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides"
      extended: |
        Everything has rhythm - cycles of rise and fall, advance and
        retreat, inhale and exhale. The pendulum swings in everything.
        Understanding rhythm allows one to work with cycles rather than
        against them, and eventually to transcend them.

    axiom: "Everything flows, out and in; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything."

    implications:
      - Life moves in cycles and rhythms
      - Trance has natural rhythms of depth
      - Breath follows rhythmic patterns
      - Moods and states naturally cycle
      - Working with rhythm enhances effectiveness

    applications_to_dreamweaving:
      - Session structure follows rhythmic arc
      - Breath pacing uses rhythm for induction
      - Fractionation uses rhythm of depth oscillation
      - Return from trance follows natural rhythm
      - Music and sound create rhythmic entrainment

    templates:
      ssml_principle: |
        <prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
        Like the tides...<break time="2s"/>
        like the breath...<break time="2s"/>

        and you flow with it now...<break time="2s"/>
        deeper on the outflow...<break time="2.5s"/>
        resting in the depths...<break time="3s"/>
        </prosody>

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 6. THE PRINCIPLE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cause_effect:
    entry_id: "traditions.hermeticism.cause_effect"
    name: "The Principle of Cause and Effect"
    number: 6

    definition:
      brief: "Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause"
      extended: |
        Nothing happens by chance - every effect has a cause, and
        every cause creates effects. Most people are effects, moved by
        external causes. The Master becomes a cause, consciously creating
        effects rather than merely experiencing them.

    axiom: "Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause."

    implications:
      - Present states have past causes
      - Present actions create future effects
      - Unconscious patterns create unconscious effects
      - Becoming conscious allows intentional causation
      - Transformation changes future effects by changing present causes

    applications_to_dreamweaving:
      - Past patterns cause present limitations
      - Changing patterns changes future outcomes
      - Setting intention creates causation
      - Unconscious beliefs cause unconscious results
      - The journey is a cause creating transformation effects

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 7. THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  gender:
    entry_id: "traditions.hermeticism.gender"
    name: "The Principle of Gender"
    number: 7

    definition:
      brief: "Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles"
      extended: |
        Gender manifests on all planes - not as biological sex but as
        the dual principles of generation. The Masculine principle is
        projective, active, initiating. The Feminine principle is
        receptive, nurturing, gestating. Both are necessary for creation.

    axiom: "Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles."

    implications:
      - Creation requires both active and receptive
      - Transformation needs both initiation and gestation
      - Consciousness has projective and receptive modes
      - Balance of principles creates wholeness
      - Neither principle alone can create

    applications_to_dreamweaving:
      - Voice carries both active guidance and receptive holding
      - Suggestion (masculine) and allowance (feminine) are both needed
      - Journey structure balances action and rest
      - Integration requires receiving, not just doing
      - Wholeness includes both principles

# THE EMERALD TABLET
# =============================================================================

emerald_tablet:
  entry_id: "traditions.hermeticism.emerald_tablet"
  name: "The Emerald Tablet (Tabula Smaragdina)"

  definition:
    brief: "Cryptic alchemical text containing the essence of Hermetic wisdom"
    extended: |
      The Emerald Tablet is a short but profound text of unknown origin,
      attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. It contains the core of
      alchemical and Hermetic teaching in condensed form. Its most
      famous axiom, "As above, so below," encapsulates the principle
      of correspondence.

  key_passages:
    correspondence: "That which is above is like to that which is below, and that which is below is like to that which is above, to accomplish the miracles of one thing."
    source: "Its father is the Sun; its mother the Moon."
    process: "Separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, gently and with great judgment."
    completion: "Thus the splendor of the whole world will be thine, and all darkness will flee from thee."

  applications_to_dreamweaving:
    - The transformation process follows alchemical stages
    - Separation and purification precede integration
    - The Great Work mirrors individual transformation
    - The journey from darkness to light follows the Tablet's pattern

# =============================================================================
# APPLICATIONS TO SESSION DESIGN
# =============================================================================

session_design_applications:

  transformation_as_alchemy:
    principle: "The Great Work of alchemy is transformation of base to gold"
    application: |
      Session structure can follow alchemical stages:
      - Nigredo (blackening): Confronting shadow, dissolution of old form
      - Albedo (whitening): Purification, washing away impurities
      - Citrinitas (yellowing): Awakening of solar consciousness
      - Rubedo (reddening): Integration, the Philosopher's Stone

  mentalism_in_visualization:
    principle: "Mind creates reality"
    application: |
      Emphasize that imaginal experiences are real experiences.
      The brain doesn't distinguish between vividly imagined
      and actually experienced. What happens in journey creates
      real neurological and psychological change.

  correspondence_in_symbolism:
    principle: "As above, so below"
    application: |
      Use consistent symbolism that corresponds across levels.
      Water symbols should consistently represent emotion.
      Fire symbols should consistently represent transformation.
      This creates coherent symbolic language.

  polarity_in_shadow_work:
    principle: "Opposites are degrees of the same thing"
    application: |
      Frame shadow integration as shifting along a polarity
      rather than eliminating something. Fear and courage
      are the same energy at different poles. Transform
      rather than remove.
