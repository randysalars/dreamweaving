# EMOTIONAL OPENERS BY OUTCOME
# Each outcome has: hook, pain_point, desire
# Used to create compelling opening that addresses the reader's state
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
openers:
  healing:
    hook: "Some healing can only happen in stillness. This is your invitation inward."
    pain_point: "There's a part of you that's been carrying weight for too long—old wounds, stored tension, emotions you've pushed aside."
    desire: "What if you could lay down that burden, just for a moment, and remember what lightness feels like?"

  transformation:
    hook: "Transformation isn't forced. It's remembered. This journey helps you remember."
    pain_point: "You've felt it—that quiet knowing that something more is waiting for you, just beyond the edge of who you've been."
    desire: "What would it mean to finally step through that threshold and meet the version of yourself you've always sensed was possible?"

  empowerment:
    hook: "Your power was never lost. It's waiting to be reclaimed."
    pain_point: "How often have you held back, stayed small, let doubt speak louder than your inner knowing?"
    desire: "Imagine standing in your full power—not arrogance, but quiet, unshakeable certainty in who you are."

  confidence:
    hook: "Confidence isn't built—it's uncovered. This journey shows you what's already there."
    pain_point: "That voice of self-doubt has been running the show for long enough."
    desire: "What would your life look like if you genuinely believed you were worthy of everything you desire?"

  relaxation:
    hook: "Your nervous system has been waiting for permission to release. This is that permission."
    pain_point: "When was the last time you truly rested—not just stopped moving, but actually let go?"
    desire: "Imagine sinking into a peace so deep that every cell in your body finally exhales."

  spiritual_growth:
    hook: "The veil between worlds is thinner than you think. This journey helps you see through it."
    pain_point: "You've sensed there's more to this existence than what meets the eye—something calling you deeper."
    desire: "What if you could access that expanded awareness, not someday, but now?"

  abundance:
    hook: "Abundance isn't attracted—it's allowed. This journey opens the gates."
    pain_point: "Scarcity thinking has been blocking the flow—that nagging feeling that there's never quite enough."
    desire: "What would shift if you truly embodied abundance, not as a concept, but as a felt sense in your body?"

  clarity:
    hook: "Clarity comes when the noise finally stops. Let's create that silence together."
    pain_point: "The fog of overwhelm, the weight of too many choices, the paralysis of uncertainty."
    desire: "What if the answers you've been seeking were already within you, just waiting for the space to emerge?"

  sleep:
    hook: "Tonight, you don't have to try to sleep. You just have to let go."
    pain_point: "Another night of racing thoughts, restless tossing, waking up more tired than when you lay down."
    desire: "What would it mean to drift into deep, restorative sleep—naturally, effortlessly, completely?"

  default:
    hook: "Something within you already knows the way. This journey helps you remember."
    pain_point: "Life moves fast. When was the last time you truly paused to reconnect with yourself?"
    desire: "What if transformation could feel less like work and more like homecoming?"
