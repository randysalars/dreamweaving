  # Session: neural-network-navigator-v3 (2024-12-01)
  - id: L001
    date: 2024-12-01
    session: neural-network-navigator-v3
    category: audio
    finding: "Static binaural frequencies miss the hypnotic arc - dynamic progressions are essential"
    evidence: "Compared v3 (static 6 Hz) with original (12→8→7→6→40→7→10 Hz progression)"
    action: "Implement dynamic binaural generation that reads frequency maps from manifest"
    confidence: high
    tags: [binaural, effectiveness, critical]
    priority: critical

  - id: L002
    date: 2024-12-01
    session: neural-network-navigator-v3
    category: audio
    finding: "Gamma bursts (40 Hz, 3 seconds) synchronized with script insight moments dramatically enhance integration"
    evidence: "Original neural-network-navigator binaural_frequency_map.json includes gamma burst at 18:45"
    action: "Add gamma burst support to binaural generator; synchronize with script timestamps"
    confidence: high
    tags: [binaural, gamma, integration]
    priority: high

  - id: L003
    date: 2024-12-01
    session: neural-network-navigator-v3
    category: audio
    finding: "Micro-modulation (±0.3 Hz at 0.05 Hz rate) during theta sections enhances entrainment"
    evidence: "Original frequency map specifies subtle 20-second oscillation cycle"
    action: "Add micro-modulation option to binaural generator for journey sections"
    confidence: medium
    tags: [binaural, modulation, enhancement]
    priority: medium

  - id: L004
    date: 2024-12-01
    session: neural-network-navigator-v3
    category: content
    finding: "Duration estimation needed BEFORE voice generation - v3 was 28% short of target"
    evidence: "Target: 30 min, Actual: 21.7 min"
    action: "Add duration estimator using word count (100 words/min at 0.88x) + pause calculation"
    confidence: high
    tags: [planning, duration, workflow]
    priority: high

  - id: L005
    date: 2024-12-01
    session: neural-network-navigator-v3
    category: audio
    finding: "Voice Neural2-A is male, not female as commonly assumed"
    evidence: "API error: 'Requested female voice, but en-US-Neural2-A is male'"
    action: "Document voice genders explicitly: Neural2-A/D/I/J = male; Neural2-C/E/F = female"
    confidence: high
    tags: [voice, documentation]
    priority: low

  - id: L006
    date: 2024-12-01
    session: neural-network-navigator-v3
    category: workflow
    finding: "binaural_frequency_map.json format from original session is excellent template"
    evidence: "Comprehensive JSON with timestamps, sync_points, modulation, gamma_burst definitions"
    action: "Create frequency map template generator; add to session creation workflow"
    confidence: high
    tags: [workflow, template, binaural]
    priority: high
    applied_to: []

  - id: L007
    date: 2024-12-01
    session: neural-network-navigator-v3
    category: workflow
    finding: "Sidechain ducking with voice threshold -30 dB and 50% ratio works well"
    evidence: "Successfully mixed voice + binaural + pink noise without masking"
    action: "Document as standard mixing practice; no changes needed"
    confidence: high
    tags: [mixing, audio, success]
    priority: low
