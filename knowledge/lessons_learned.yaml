  summary: 'Auto-generated session from topic: The Rite of the Solar Heart Anointment
    is a sacred ritual that aligns your heart with the ancient Solar Intelligence
    of Joy. In the first step, the Summoning of the Radiant Sun, you stand beneath
    a vast golden sun hovering inches above you, its surface rippling with laughter-light.
    Then comes the Oil of Aeternal Joy, as a beam of sunlight liquefies into golden
    oil that pours gently into your heart center, filling you with euphoria, warm
    innocence, cosmic safety, divine affirmation, and heart-opening bliss. Finally,
    during the Coronation of the Joyful Sovereign, a crown of solar petals forms above
    your head, and as it settles, a voice speaks: You are now a Keeper of the Solar
    Joy Flame. This act completes the anointment, permanently igniting the Solar Heart-Flame
    within you.'
