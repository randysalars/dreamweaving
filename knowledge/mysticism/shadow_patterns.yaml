      unless it feels right...
      Just noticing...
      with curiosity...
      without judgment...

      And if you were to ask this part...

      whatever arises is valuable...

      how long this part has been here...
      When did it first appear?...

      [pause]
      This part learned to be this way...
      for a reason...

      a quality, a strength, a truth...
      that was yours all along...

  integration:
    template: |
      And this part of you...
      so long in exile...
      can come home now...
      welcomed back into wholeness...

      but simply another facet...
      of who you truly are...
