# Proprioceptive Templates for DVE-04 (Embodiment & Proprioception)
# Provides detailed body awareness and internal sensation language for Dreamweaving
# Version: 1.0
# Created: 2025-12-09

version: "1.0"
created: "2025-12-09"
purpose: "Templates for deep body awareness and proprioceptive activation in imaginal space"

# ============================================================================
# OVERVIEW
# ============================================================================
#
# Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement in space.
# These templates help listeners develop awareness of their imaginal body,
# creating deeper embodiment in the visualization experience.
#
# Key concepts:
# - Interoception: Internal body sensations (heartbeat, breath, temperature)
# - Proprioception: Body position, movement, spatial orientation
# - Kinesthesia: Sense of movement and muscle tension
# - Imaginal body: The experienced body within visualization
#
# Integration with DVE-04:
# These templates provide the language patterns used in DVE-04 module.
# They can be combined and adapted based on journey context.
