# PRANAYAMA - Breath Practices for Dreamweaving
# =============================================================================
# Breath is the bridge between conscious and unconscious, body and mind.
# These pranayama (breath control) practices provide specific techniques
# for inducing states, regulating the nervous system, and deepening trance.
#
# Usage: Select breath patterns based on desired state and outcome.
#        Integrate breath cues into appropriate journey phases.

# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================

overview:
  name: "Pranayama"
  origin: "Sanskrit - prana (life force) + ayama (extension/control)"

  definition:
    brief: "Conscious regulation of breath to influence mind and energy states"
    extended: |
      Pranayama is the yogic science of breath control, recognizing that
      breath patterns directly influence mental states, nervous system
      function, and subtle energy. In hypnotic work, breath is the most
      accessible tool for state change - always available, directly
      influential, and under voluntary control.
    essence: "As the breath, so the mind"

  mechanism: |
    - Slow exhales activate parasympathetic (rest/digest) response
    - Fast breath activates sympathetic (alertness/energy) response
    - Breath holds concentrate prana and still the mind
    - Nasal breathing activates different brain regions than mouth breathing
    - Rhythm entrains brainwaves and heart rate

  dreamweaving_application: |
    Breath cues are woven throughout sessions to:
    - Deepen relaxation during induction
    - Regulate nervous system during emotional material
    - Create rhythm for trance deepening
    - Anchor states to breath patterns
    - Support return during reorientation

  # 4-7-8 BREATHING (Relaxing Breath)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  four_seven_eight:
    entry_id: "embodiment.pranayama.four_seven_eight"
    name: "4-7-8 Relaxing Breath"
    sanskrit_name: "Modified Pranayama"
    type: "calming"

    definition:
      brief: "Powerful calming breath with extended exhale and hold"
      extended: |
        Popularized by Dr. Andrew Weil, this pattern combines extended
        exhale with a hold that activates the parasympathetic nervous
        system. It's considered a "natural tranquilizer" and is excellent
        for anxiety, sleep induction, and trance deepening.

    pattern:
      inhale: 4 counts
      hold: 7 counts
      exhale: 8 counts
      rounds: 3-4

    effects:
      - Rapid parasympathetic activation
      - Reduces anxiety and stress
      - Promotes sleep onset
      - Deepens trance states
      - Lowers heart rate and blood pressure

    applications:
      journey_phases: [induction, deepening]
      outcome_alignment: [relaxation, healing, release]

  coherent_breathing:
    entry_id: "embodiment.pranayama.coherent"
    name: "Coherent Breathing"
    type: "calming"

    definition:
      brief: "Equal inhale and exhale at ~5 breaths per minute for HRV optimization"
      extended: |
        Coherent breathing entrains the cardiovascular system to an
        optimal rhythm, maximizing heart rate variability (HRV) and
        promoting calm alertness. The 5-6 second inhale and exhale
        creates a rhythm that synchronizes heart, brain, and breath.

    pattern:
      inhale: 5-6 counts
      exhale: 5-6 counts
      rate: "5 breaths per minute"
      rounds: continuous

    effects:
      - Optimizes HRV
      - Promotes calm alertness
      - Balances autonomic nervous system
      - Excellent for sustained trance
      - Reduces anxiety without sedation

    applications:
      journey_phases: [induction, deepening, journey]

  extended_exhale:

    name: "Extended Exhale Breathing"
    type: "calming"

    definition:
      brief: "Simple pattern where exhale is longer than inhale"
      extended: |
        The simplest vagal activation technique - any pattern where
        exhale exceeds inhale activates the parasympathetic response.
        2:1 ratio (e.g., 4 in, 8 out) is gentle; 1:2 is stronger.

    pattern:
      inhale: 4 counts
      exhale: 6-8 counts
      ratio: "1:1.5 to 1:2"
      rounds: continuous

    effects:
      - Reliable parasympathetic activation
      - Easy to learn and maintain
      - Promotes relaxation without intense focus required

    applications:
      journey_phases: [induction, deepening, integration]

  # BELLY BREATHING (Diaphragmatic)

  belly_breathing:
    entry_id: "embodiment.pranayama.belly"
    name: "Diaphragmatic / Belly Breathing"
    type: "calming"

    definition:
      brief: "Breathing into the belly using the diaphragm"
      extended: |
        Most people breathe shallowly into the chest. Diaphragmatic
        breathing moves the breath down into the belly, activating
        the vagus nerve and promoting deep relaxation. Foundation
        for all pranayama practices.

    instruction: |
      Breathe so that your belly rises on inhale and falls on exhale.
      The chest should move minimally. Place a hand on belly to feel
      the movement.

    effects:
      - Activates vagus nerve
      - Promotes relaxation
      - Increases oxygen exchange
      - Grounds awareness in body

    applications:
      journey_phases: [pre_talk, induction, integration, reorientation]

    name: "Alternate Nostril Breathing"
    sanskrit_name: "Nadi Shodhana"
    type: "balancing"

    definition:
      brief: "Alternating breath through left and right nostrils to balance energy"
      extended: |
        Nadi Shodhana balances the left and right hemispheres of the brain,
        corresponding to ida (lunar, cooling) and pingala (solar, heating)
        nadis. It calms the mind while maintaining alertness - excellent
        for preparation before deep work.

    pattern:
      close_right: "Inhale left nostril"
      close_both: "Hold briefly"
      close_left: "Exhale right nostril"
      repeat_reversed: true
      rounds: 5-10

    effects:
      - Balances hemispheres
      - Calms while maintaining alertness
      - Clears energy channels
      - Prepares for meditation/trance

    applications:
      journey_phases: [pre_talk, induction]

    sanskrit_name: "Sama Vritti"
    type: "balancing"

    definition:
      brief: "Equal duration inhale, hold, exhale, hold - creates stability"
      extended: |
        Used by Navy SEALs and other high-performance groups for
        stress regulation. The equal counts create a stable, balanced
        state - calm but alert. Excellent for maintaining presence
        during challenging material.

    pattern:
      inhale: 4 counts
      hold_in: 4 counts
      exhale: 4 counts
      hold_out: 4 counts
      rounds: 4-8

    effects:
      - Balances nervous system
      - Promotes calm alertness
      - Reduces stress response
      - Maintains grounded presence

    applications:
      journey_phases: [pre_talk, induction, integration]

    sanskrit_name: "Kapalabhati"
    type: "activating"

    definition:
      brief: "Rapid rhythmic breathing with active exhale for energy and clarity"
      extended: |
        Kapalabhati ("skull shining") involves rapid, rhythmic breaths
        with emphasis on active exhale. It energizes, clears the mind,
        and activates solar plexus energy. Use sparingly in hypnotic
        work for specific energy activation purposes.

    pattern:
      emphasis: "Active exhale, passive inhale"
      rate: "1-2 breaths per second"
      duration: "30 seconds to 1 minute"

    effects:
      - Energizes and awakens
      - Clears mental fog
      - Activates solar plexus
      - Can precede deep relaxation (contrast)

    definition:
      brief: "Gentle activation through inhale emphasis"
      extended: |
        A softer alternative to breath of fire - simply emphasizing
        the inhale over the exhale creates mild activation without
        intensity. Useful for return phases or gentle awakening.

    pattern:
      inhale: "Full, intentional"
      exhale: "Natural release"
      count: "5-10 breaths"

    effects:
      - Gentle activation
      - Increases alertness
      - Supports return from trance
      - Energizes without agitation

        Linking trance depth to breath creates a powerful anchor.

        When the speaker's rhythm matches the listener's breath,
        rapport deepens and trance enhances. Pause timing can
        suggest inhale and exhale moments.

    technique: |
      - Pause on listener's exhale for deepening suggestions
      - Time key words to fall on exhales
      - Use phrase length to suggest breath rhythm
