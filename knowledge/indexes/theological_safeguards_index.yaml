# THEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE (CORE)
# =============================================================================

core_principle: |
  Dreamweaving engages God-designed imagination - not spirits.
  It uses metaphor, not invocation.
  It treats archetypes as psychological metaphors, not spiritual beings.
  It keeps the will fully active.
  It honors Scripture as the framework of truth.
  It strengthens discernment instead of dissolving it.
  It points people toward Christ.
