# =============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# =============================================================================
# When generating scripts for specific audiences:
# 1. Identify the listener's tradition preference (if any)
# 2. Look up archetype in tradition section
# 3. Use tradition-specific name in script if requested
# 4. Fall back to universal name if no tradition specified
#
# Example:
#   Archetype: inner_healer
#   For Christian audience: "Holy Spirit as Comforter & Restorer"
#   For Hindu audience: "Dhanvantri (Divine Physician)"
#   For universal: "The Inner Healer"
