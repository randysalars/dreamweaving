# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================

overview:
  name: "Kundalini & Chakra System"

  definition:
    brief: "Seven-center energy model mapping consciousness from survival to transcendence"
    extended: |
      The chakra system is a map of human consciousness organized vertically
      along the spine, from the root (Muladhara) at the base to the crown
      (Sahasrara) at the top of the head. Each chakra represents a level of
      development, a set of psychological functions, and specific life themes.
      Kundalini refers to the dormant energy said to reside at the root,
      which when awakened rises through the chakras toward enlightenment.

      For Dreamweaving, this system provides:
      - A vertical journey structure (ascending or descending)
      - Specific imagery, colors, and sounds for each center
      - Psychological themes to address at each level
      - Natural progression for transformation work

  traditions:
    - Tantra (Hindu)
    - Yoga (various schools)
    - Tibetan Buddhism (subtle body)
    - Western esoteric adaptations

  relevance_to_dreamweaving: |
    Chakra-based journeys provide natural structure for vertical
    transformation experiences. Ascending journeys move from grounding
    to transcendence; descending journeys bring insight into embodiment.
    Each chakra offers specific themes for targeted healing work.
