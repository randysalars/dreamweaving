    Cross-tradition enlightenment framework synthesizing awakening wisdom from
    Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, Christian Mysticism, Sufism, and Daoism.
    Provides Dreamweaving templates for facilitating enlightenment experiences.

  core_insight: |
    Enlightenment across traditions is a shift from identifying as a separate self
    to identifying as spacious awareness itself. The "I" doesn't disappear—it becomes
    transparent, revealing boundless consciousness that was always present.

    tradition: "Buddhism"

    definition:
      brief: "Recognition that no fixed self exists; liberation from the illusion of separate identity"
      extended: |
        In Buddhism, enlightenment (bodhi) is the direct recognition of anatta—no-self.
        The meditator discovers that what we call "self" is a constantly changing stream
        of sensations, thoughts, and perceptions with no fixed owner. This isn't nihilism
        but liberation: consciousness continues, but without the prison of "me" vs "other."
        The result is the end of suffering (dukkha) because there's no separate self to suffer.

    key_terms:
      - anatta: "No-self; the absence of a permanent, unchanging self"
      - bodhi: "Awakening; direct insight into the nature of reality"
      - nirvana: "Extinguishing of craving and delusion; unconditioned peace"
      - shunyata: "Emptiness; all phenomena lack inherent existence"
      - dukkha: "Suffering; unsatisfactoriness arising from clinging"

    stages:

      - "Invite search for the 'self' that is supposedly suffering"
      - "Use body-scanning to reveal the self as process, not thing"
      - "Employ 'turning attention around' to notice the noticer"

  advaita:

    name: "Advaita Vedanta (Nonduality)"
    tradition: "Hinduism - Advaita Vedanta"

    definition:
      brief: "Recognition that individual consciousness (Atman) is identical with universal consciousness (Brahman)"
      extended: |
        Advaita means "not two." The separate self is maya (illusion)—a case of mistaken
        identity. You are not the body-mind; you are the awareness in which body-mind appears.
        This awareness is Brahman—infinite, unchanging, the ground of all existence.
        Enlightenment is simply recognizing what you already are: "I am That" (Tat Tvam Asi).

    key_terms:
      - atman: "True Self; pure awareness identical with Brahman"
      - brahman: "Ultimate reality; infinite consciousness"
      - maya: "Illusion; the apparent separation of self from Self"
      - moksha: "Liberation; recognition of one's true nature"
      - aham_brahmasmi: "'I am Brahman'; the great realization"
      - tat_tvam_asi: "'You are That'; pointing to nondual nature"

        transcendence: "I am not thoughts—I am the space in which thoughts arise"
      causal_body:
        description: "Deep sleep; formless potential"
        transcendence: "Even in dreamless sleep, 'I' persist—as pure awareness"

    neti_neti:
      meaning: "Not this, not this"
      method: |
        Systematically recognize what you are NOT:
        - I am not the body (it changes; I remain)
        - I am not sensations (they come and go; I remain)
        - I am not emotions (they arise and pass; I remain)
        - I am not thoughts (they appear and disappear; I remain)
        What remains when all objects are negated? Pure Subject—awareness itself.

    dreamweaving_methods:
      - "Guide 'neti neti' process—systematically disidentifying from objects"
      - "Use 'I am' as anchor, then release the objects of identity"
      - "Invoke witness consciousness watching the dream of separation"

  christian_mysticism:

    tradition: "Christian Mysticism"

    definition:
      brief: "Divine union where the soul becomes one with God while retaining personhood"
      extended: |
        Christian mysticism speaks of theosis (deification)—becoming one with God's nature
        through grace while remaining a distinct person. Unlike Eastern nonduality, the self
        isn't dissolved but transformed, becoming a "partaker of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4).
        The mystic experiences God not as other but as the deepest ground of their own being.

    key_terms:
      - theosis: "Deification; participation in divine nature"
      - unio_mystica: "Mystical union; soul's marriage with God"
      - dark_night: "Purifying passage through spiritual dryness"
      - infused_contemplation: "God-given awareness beyond effort"
      - interior_castle: "Teresa's map of the soul's journey inward"

      night_of_soul:
        description: "Deepest purification; feeling abandoned by God"
        purpose: "Final release of ego-will; total surrender"

    dreamweaving_methods:

      - "Use Centering Prayer structure: sacred word → release → rest"

  sufism:

    name: "Sufi Annihilation (Fana)"
    tradition: "Sufism (Islamic Mysticism)"

    definition:
      brief: "Annihilation of the ego-self in divine Reality, followed by subsistence in God"
      extended: |
        Fana is the "passing away" of the false self—the nafs—in the overwhelming
        presence of the Beloved (God). It's not destruction but transformation: the drop
        realizes it was always the ocean. After fana comes baqa—abiding in God while
        functioning in the world. The Sufi becomes a "polished mirror" reflecting divine light.

    key_terms:
      - fana: "Annihilation; ego-death in divine presence"
      - baqa: "Subsistence; abiding in God after fana"
      - nafs: "Ego-self; the veil between soul and God"
      - dhikr: "Remembrance; repetition of divine names"
      - hal: "State; temporary mystical experience"

      brief: "Alignment with the natural flow of existence; effortless action through non-resistance"
      extended: |
        Daoist enlightenment isn't dramatic awakening but return to naturalness (ziran).
        The sage flows with the Dao like water—yielding, effortless, taking the shape of
        circumstances without losing essence. Wu wei (non-action) doesn't mean doing nothing
        but acting without forcing—the archer who releases the arrow without "trying" to hit.

    key_terms:
      - dao: "The Way; the natural order of existence"
      - wu_wei: "Non-action; effortless action aligned with Dao"
      - ziran: "Naturalness; being authentically oneself"

  note: |
    Dreamweaving cannot "cause" enlightenment (it's already present).
    But it can facilitate glimpses, ripen conditions, and stabilize recognition.

      description: "Language that points beyond language to direct recognition"

      technique: |
        Use questions and paradoxes that short-circuit conceptual mind:
        - "Who is aware of this thought?"
        - "Can you find the boundary between inside and outside?"
        - "Where does 'you' end and 'not-you' begin?"

      technique: |

        Include safety language: "This is always optional and safe to stop."

white_light:
  entry_id: "consciousness_maps.enlightenment.white_light"
  name: "White Light Phenomenology"

  description: |
    The "White Light Experience" appears across traditions—NDE, mystical experiences,
    psychedelic journeys, spontaneous awakenings. It typically involves:
    - Perception of brilliant, non-physical light
    - Profound peace and love
    - Sense of coming home
    - Loss of separate self in the light
    - Sometimes contact with presences or voices

  interpretations:
    neuroscience_view: "Possible DMT release, oxygen deprivation effects"
    mystical_view: "Direct encounter with divine/ultimate reality"
    nondual_view: "Recognition of awareness as luminous in nature"
    buddhist_view: "Clear Light of Mind (rigpa, Buddha-nature)"
    integral_view: "All interpretations may be partially true at different levels"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

future_technologies:
  entry_id: "consciousness_maps.enlightenment.future_tech"
  name: "Speculative Consciousness Technologies"

  note: |
    These represent potential future developments in consciousness facilitation.
    Some are technically possible now, others are conceptual explorations.

  technologies:

    ego_transparency_training:
      description: |
        Gradual training protocol moving from "I have experiences" to
        "Experiencing is happening" to "There is only This."
        Multi-session progressive deepening with integration periods.

      protocol_sketch:
        - session_1: "Notice the witness observing experience"
        - session_2: "Notice there's no entity 'doing' the witnessing"
        - session_3: "Rest as witnessing without a witness"
        - session_4: "Recognize even 'witnessing' is appearing"
        - session_5: "Simply This—prior to all descriptions"

    nondual_field_induction:
      description: |
        Binaural/audio frequencies paired with precise linguistic patterns
        designed to temporarily reduce DMN activity and facilitate
        subject-object collapse.

      components:
        - binaural: "Gamma (40 Hz) for coherence, transitioning to theta (4-7 Hz)"
        - linguistics: "Paradoxical pointers, self-referential loops"
        - pacing: "Increasing pause lengths, dissolving sentence structure"

    enlightenment_archetype_library:
      description: |
        AI-generated avatars of awakened beings (Buddha, Rumi, Ramana, etc.)
        that can respond dynamically to listener's questions with tradition-
        appropriate nondual pointing.

      interaction_model: |
        Listener asks internal question → AI-avatar responds with appropriate
        teaching/pointer → Listener integrates in silence → Repeat

    collective_awakening_protocols:
      description: |
        Group Dreamweaving sessions where multiple listeners simultaneously
        enter shared contemplative space, potentially amplifying recognition
        through collective field effects.

      design_notes:
        - "Synchronized audio delivery"
        - "Shared intention setting"
        - "Post-session integration circles"

    vr_enlightenment_simulations:
      description: |
        Virtual reality environments that simulate enlightenment phenomenology:
        - Body dissolution experiences (avatar becoming transparent)
        - Infinite space immersion
        - Light tunnel/NDE simulations
        - Meeting awakened archetype figures

      ethical_considerations:
        - "Clear labeling as simulations"
        - "Integration support required"
        - "Not a replacement for genuine practice"

# SECTION 8: SAFETY AND ETHICS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

safety:
  entry_id: "consciousness_maps.enlightenment.safety"
  name: "Safety and Ethical Considerations"

  core_principles:
    - "Enlightenment experiences can be destabilizing for unprepared listeners"
    - "Some individuals have trauma or dissociative conditions that require special care"
    - "Always include grounding and integration guidance"
    - "Never claim Dreamweaving 'causes' enlightenment—it removes obstacles"
    - "Respect that some listeners are seeking relaxation, not ego dissolution"

  contraindications:
    absolute:
      - "Active psychosis or dissociative disorder"
      - "Recent severe trauma (within 6 months)"
      - "Suicidal ideation"

    relative:
      - "History of depersonalization/derealization"
      - "Severe anxiety disorders"
      - "Early spiritual emergency"

  safety_language_templates:
    permission: |
      "You are always in control...
      at any time, you can simply return to normal waking awareness...
      there is nothing here that can harm you..."

    grounding: |
      "Feel your body... solid and present...
      feel the surface beneath you...
      take a deeper breath... feeling yourself fully here..."

    integration: |
      "Whatever you experienced... integrates gently...
      at a pace that serves your wellbeing...
      there is no rush... only unfolding..."

  post_session_guidance:
    - "Encourage journaling or reflection"
    - "Recommend nature walks, gentle movement"
    - "Suggest talking with trusted friend or teacher"
    - "Advise against major decisions for 24 hours"
    - "Provide resources for further exploration"
