      Fire is the element of transformation, will, and spiritual aspiration.

      material into refined essence, and illuminate darkness with conscious awareness.

      Fire purifies through destruction of form, releasing energy for new creation.

      I call upon the sacred earth,
      The ground that holds all things,
      The body of the Mother,
      The foundation of all that is.
      May this earth ground me,
      Support me, contain me,
      And remind me of my belonging.

    sensory_description: |
      Feel the solid ground beneath you, the density and weight of matter.
      See the rich browns and greens, the textures of bark and stone and soil.
      Hear the deep silence that earth holds, punctuated by gentle sounds of life.
      Smell the rich humus, the minerals, the green growth. Taste the mineral
      essence, the grounding heaviness that reminds you: you belong here.

  definition:
    brief: "The unifying principle that transcends and includes all elements"
    extended: |
      Spirit, also called Aether or Quintessence, is the fifth element that
      permeates and unifies all others. It is the element of pure consciousness,
      divine presence, and the animating force of the universe. Spirit
      represents the point where all elements meet and transcend their
      individual natures. In the psyche, spirit corresponds to the Higher Self,
      soul, divine spark, and the experience of unity consciousness.

      needs no object. The peace that holds all experience.
