overview:
  name: "Sacred Geometry"

  definition:
    brief: "Universal geometric patterns that reflect the fundamental order of creation"
    extended: |
      Sacred geometry is the study of geometric patterns, shapes, and proportions
      that appear throughout nature, art, architecture, and spiritual symbolism
      across cultures. These forms are considered "sacred" because they reveal
      the underlying mathematical harmony of creation - from atoms to galaxies,
      from DNA to nautilus shells.

      For Dreamweaving, sacred geometry provides:
      - Universal visual symbols that resonate across cultures
      - Structural templates for journey design
      - Energetic frameworks for transformation
      - Contemplation objects for trance deepening
      - Integration of left-brain (mathematical) and right-brain (symbolic)

  core_principles:
    - "As above, so below - patterns repeat at all scales"
    - "Form follows frequency - geometry is frozen music"
    - "Nature builds using these fundamental forms"
    - "Consciousness recognizes these patterns instinctively"
    - "Geometry provides container for transformation"

  relevance_to_dreamweaving: |
    Sacred geometric forms serve as:
    - Visual anchors during visualization
    - Portals and gateways for transition
    - Containers for energy work
    - Structural templates for session design
    - Universal symbols transcending cultural specificity

        The point represents pure potential before manifestation - the
        seed of creation, the singularity, the first mark on blank space.
        It is simultaneously nothing (dimensionless) and everything (containing
        all possibility). In meditation, it serves as a focus point.

      extended: |
        The circle is the most fundamental sacred form - having no beginning
        or end, it represents eternity, wholeness, and the divine. It is the
        shape traced by the first movement from the point, creating boundary
        while remaining infinite. All points on the circumference are
        equidistant from center, representing equality and balance.

        Their union represents the marriage of opposites, the Hermetic axiom

    definition:
      brief: "The spiral of growth and evolution found throughout nature"
      extended: |
        The golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is
        the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618). It appears in nautilus shells,
        hurricanes, galaxies, and DNA. It represents organic growth,
        evolution, and the path of expanding consciousness.

    attributes:
      element: "Spirit, Air"
      ratio: "Phi (φ)"
