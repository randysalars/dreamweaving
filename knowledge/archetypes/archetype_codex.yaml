    definition:
      brief: "White Flame archetype for regeneration and cellular intelligence"
      extended: |
        The Inner Healer represents the innate wisdom of the body to restore
        itself to wholeness. This archetype awakens cellular intelligence,
        activates regenerative pathways, and reminds the listener that healing
        is not something done TO them, but something awakened WITHIN them.
        Appears as white light or emerald flame, often with gentle hands.

    definition:
      brief: "Supreme healing authority with power over all conditions"
      extended: |
        The Great Physician represents absolute healing authority - the archetype
        that can heal what seems impossible. Unlike the Inner Healer (which awakens
        internal healing), the Great Physician brings external healing power and
        divine intervention. Appears with piercing yet compassionate eyes, robed in
        white, often with hands extended in blessing.

    definition:
      brief: "Feminine divine presence that indwells and restores from within"
      extended: |
        The Shekinah Restorer represents the indwelling feminine divine presence
        that restores through gentle, sustained presence rather than active
        intervention. She comforts, soothes, and repairs the subtle bodies through
        pure loving presence. Often appears as soft rose-gold light, or a maternal
        presence of infinite patience and tenderness.

    definition:
      brief: "Archetype of complete destruction and rebirth through sacred fire"
      extended: |
        The Phoenix represents the ultimate transformation archetype - complete
        destruction of what was, followed by glorious rebirth. Unlike gentle
        transformation, Phoenix work burns away completely, leaving only the
        indestructible core from which the new self rises. Appears as magnificent
        firebird with golden and crimson flames.

    definition:
      brief: "Archetype that destroys what must end for new growth"
      extended: |
        The Sacred Deathbringer represents the necessary destruction that precedes
        all renewal. Unlike the Phoenix (which focuses on rebirth), this archetype
        specializes in the ending itself - the cutting of cords, destruction of
        patterns, and dissolution of what no longer serves. Appears as dark but
        not evil - a fierce protector energy that removes obstacles.

      extended: |
        The Oracle of Light represents pure perception unclouded by ego, fear,
        or desire. This archetype sees all timelines, knows all truths, and speaks
        only what is needed. Unlike fortune-telling, the Oracle reveals internal
        truths and helps the listener access their own knowing. Appears with
        luminous eyes, often in white or silver robes, sometimes with third eye visible.
