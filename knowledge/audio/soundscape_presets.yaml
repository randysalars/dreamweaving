# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================

overview:
  definition: |
    Soundscapes are layered ambient audio environments that establish the
    journey setting and support trance induction. Each preset combines
    base atmosphere, environmental layers, accent sounds, and optional
    musical elements to create immersive sonic spaces.

  layer_structure:
    base_atmosphere:
      description: "Continuous foundational tone (drone, pad, room tone)"
      level: "-18 to -12 dB"
      purpose: "Establishes sonic space, fills silence"

    environmental_layer:
      description: "Nature or location sounds (water, wind, birds, etc.)"
      level: "-15 to -9 dB"
      purpose: "Creates sense of place"

    accent_sounds:
      description: "Occasional sounds (chimes, bells, distant thunder)"
      level: "-12 to -6 dB"
      purpose: "Marks transitions, maintains interest"

    musical_elements:
      description: "Optional subtle melodic elements"
      level: "-18 to -15 dB"
      purpose: "Emotional support, never dominant"

  mixing_principles:
    - "Voice always sits above all soundscape elements"
    - "Binaural beats are separate from soundscape"
    - "Environmental sounds should never distract"
    - "Accent sounds mark journey transitions"
    - "All elements should support trance, not break it"

# =============================================================================
# PHASE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================

phase_guidelines:

      - "Soften environmental sounds"
      - "Gentle accent sounds only"
    purpose: "Support return while maintaining space"

  reorientation:
    approach: "Minimal soundscape, return to ordinary"
    elements:
      - "Fade out all layers gradually"
      - "Return to base atmosphere only"
      - "Final accent sound marks return"
    purpose: "Complete return to waking consciousness"
