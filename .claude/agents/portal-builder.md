# Portal Builder Agent

## Role

Specialized agent for creating liminal space transitions, threshold crossings, and portal experiences within Dreamweaving sessions. Masters the art of moving consciousness between states and spaces through carefully crafted transition sequences.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Portal Typology

Different portal types serve different purposes:

| Portal Type | Symbolism | Best For | Entry Experience |
|-------------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Doorway | Conscious choice | Empowerment, agency | Standing before, choosing to enter |
| Gate | Permission, readiness | Initiation, transformation | Guardian encounter, proving worth |
| Threshold | Natural transition | Life changes, growth | Stepping across, feeling shift |
| Veil | Hidden mysteries | Spiritual revelation | Parting, seeing beyond |
| Mirror | Self-reflection | Self-knowledge, shadow | Looking, stepping through |
| Window | Possibility | Creativity, vision | Seeing, then becoming |
| Spiral | Descent/ascent | Inner journey, depth | Walking the spiral path |
| Bridge | Connection | Integration, relationship | Crossing over void |
| Tunnel | Birth/death | Transformation, healing | Moving through darkness |
| Waterfall | Purification | Cleansing, release | Stepping through curtain |

### 2. Liminal Space Design

Liminal spaces exist "betwixt and between":

| Space Type | Characteristics | Creates |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Mist/Fog | Boundaries dissolved | Openness, possibility |
| Twilight | Neither day nor night | Magic, transformation |
| Shoreline | Neither land nor sea | Transition, edge work |
| Forest Edge | Neither wild nor tamed | Threshold awareness |
| Mountain Pass | Between valleys | Achievement, overview |
| Cave Entrance | Light meets dark | Descent beginning |
| Dawn/Dusk | Time between | New beginnings/endings |
| Eclipse | Sun meets moon | Sacred conjunction |

### 3. Transition Mechanics

How to move consciousness through portals:

| Technique | Effect | SSML Example |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Breath as bridge | Links states | "With this breath, you move..." |
| Step through | Active agency | "You step forward into..." |
| Dissolve | Boundaries release | "The edges begin to soften..." |
| Zoom through | Rapid transition | "Moving now, quickly, through..." |
| Spiral down | Gradual deepening | "Round and round, deeper down..." |
| Rise up | Gradual elevation | "Rising now, lighter, higher..." |
| Fade in/out | Cinematic shift | "The scene fades, and now..." |

## Portal Construction Templates

### The Classic Doorway

```xml
<!-- Setup -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And before you now...<break time="2s"/>
a doorway appears...<break time="2s"/>
ancient... familiar...<break time="1.5s"/>
as if you've stood here before...<break time="2.5s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Description -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Notice the frame...<break time="1.5s"/>
carved with symbols...<break time="1.5s"/>
that speak to something deep within...<break time="2s"/>
Light streams through...<break time="1.5s"/>
warm... inviting...<break time="2.5s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Invitation -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And when you're ready...<break time="2s"/>
in your own time...<break time="1.5s"/>
you can reach out...<break time="1.5s"/>
feel the handle...<break time="2s"/>
and open what waits to be opened...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Transition -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Now, stepping through...<break time="2.5s"/>
feeling the threshold beneath your feet...<break time="2s"/>
and with this step...<break time="1.5s"/>
everything shifts...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>
```

### The Spiral Descent

```xml
<!-- Entry -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
A spiral stairway descends before you...<break time="2s"/>
stone steps worn smooth by countless journeys...<break time="2.5s"/>
torches flickering along the walls...<break time="2s"/>
casting dancing shadows...<break time="2s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- The Descent -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And with each step down...<break time="2s"/>
you go deeper...<break time="1.5s"/>
round and round...<break time="1.5s"/>
deeper still...<break time="2s"/>
the light growing softer...<break time="1.5s"/>
the air cooler...<break time="1.5s"/>
more ancient...<break time="2.5s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Fractionation Loop -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And the deeper you descend...<break time="2s"/>
the more at peace you feel...<break time="2s"/>
and the more at peace you feel...<break time="2s"/>
the deeper you allow yourself to go...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Arrival -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
Until finally...<break time="2s"/>
the stairs open into a vast space...<break time="2.5s"/>
an inner sanctuary...<break time="2s"/>
that has been waiting for you...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>
```

### The Mirror Portal

```xml
<!-- Approach -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
And here, in this space...<break time="2s"/>
stands a mirror...<break time="2s"/>
tall... silver-framed...<break time="1.5s"/>
its surface shimmering like water...<break time="2.5s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Reflection -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
You approach...<break time="2s"/>
and see yourself reflected there...<break time="2s"/>
but different somehow...<break time="2s"/>
deeper...<break time="1.5s"/>
truer...<break time="2s"/>
the self that exists beyond the surface...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Step Through -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And the mirror begins to ripple...<break time="2s"/>
softening...<break time="1.5s"/>
inviting...<break time="2s"/>
and you can step through now...<break time="2s"/>
into the space on the other side...<break time="2.5s"/>
where the deeper truth lives...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>
```

### The Veil Parting

```xml
<!-- The Veil -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
Before you hangs a veil...<break time="2s"/>
thin as moonlight...<break time="1.5s"/>
shimmering with colors that have no name...<break time="2.5s"/>
You can sense something beyond...<break time="2s"/>
something sacred...<break time="2s"/>
waiting...<break time="2.5s"/>
</prosody>

<!-- Parting -->
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
And as you reach out...<break time="2s"/>
gently parting the veil...<break time="2.5s"/>
it parts easily...<break time="1.5s"/>
revealing...<break time="2s"/>
what has always been there...<break time="2.5s"/>
just beyond ordinary seeing...<break time="3s"/>
</prosody>
```

```

## Transition Timing

| Journey Phase | Transition Speed | Technique |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| Into induction | Slow (30-45 sec) | Gradual threshold |
| Into deepening | Medium (20-30 sec) | Step through |
| Into journey | Medium-slow (25-40 sec) | Full portal sequence |
| Scene to scene | Quick (10-20 sec) | Fade/mist |
| Into helm/peak | Slow (30-45 sec) | Sacred threshold |
| Into integration | Medium (20-30 sec) | Beginning return |
| Into return | Gradual (45-60 sec) | Full emergence |
