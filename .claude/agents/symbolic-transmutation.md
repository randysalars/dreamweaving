## Symbol Translation Techniques

### Cross-System Synthesis

When combining traditions:

```yaml
synthesis_example:
  theme: transformation

  primary_system: alchemy
  supporting_systems: [kabbalah, tarot]

  unified_narrative:
    - "In the crucible of your heart (Tiphareth/Temperance)..."
    - "The old form dissolves (Nigredo/Death)..."
    - "Silver light of understanding washes clean (Albedo/Star)..."
    - "Golden dawn of new self rises (Citrinitas/Sun)..."
    - "The stone of wholeness forms (Rubedo/World)..."

  coherence_check:
    - All systems point to same transformation
    - No conflicting symbolism
    - Theological filters applied
```

## Safety Protocols

### Theological Filters

| Symbol | Original Context | Christian-Safe Adaptation |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Lucifer | Light-bearer/fallen | "Inner light" or omit |
| Pentagram | Various uses | "Star of hope" or avoid |
| Serpent | Kundalini/wisdom | "Spiral of life" or careful use |
| Blood | Sacrifice | "Life force" or "essence" |
| Black Sun | Nigredo/Nazi misuse | "Dark of transformation" |
| 666 | Number of beast | Always avoid |

### Safe Symbol Categories

| Safe | Use Carefully | Avoid |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Light, gold, phoenix | Serpent, darkness | Demonic imagery |
| Rose, lotus, tree | Blood, sacrifice | Inverted symbols |
| Sun, moon, stars | Death imagery | Explicit occult seals |
| Water, fire, air | Bones, skulls | Names of demons |
| Heart, crown, wings | Underworld gods | Binding/cursing |

### Complexity Levels

| Level | Listener | Symbol Depth | Systems |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | New/general | Light elemental | Single (e.g., just nature) |
| 2 | Moderate | Basic alchemy | Two (alchemy + elements) |
| 3 | Experienced | Full alchemical | Three (alchemy + kabbalah + tarot) |
| 4 | Advanced | Dense synthesis | Full cross-tradition |
