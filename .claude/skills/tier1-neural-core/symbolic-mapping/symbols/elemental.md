# Elemental Symbolism

Fire, water, earth, air correspondences for Dreamweaving journeys.

---

## Core Principle

Elements are **universal human symbols** that carry consistent emotional and transformational meanings across cultures. In Dreamweaving, they serve as safe, non-theological scaffolding for experience.

<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  A gentle flame... <break time="1.5s"/>
