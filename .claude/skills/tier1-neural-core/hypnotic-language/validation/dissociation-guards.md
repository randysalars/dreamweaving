# Dissociation Guards

Safety boundaries to prevent unhealthy detachment from body, identity, or reality.

---

## Core Principle

**Trance ≠ Dissociation**

Healthy trance is focused attention with maintained connection to body and identity.
Dissociation is disconnection from body, identity, or reality. We never want this.

---

## The Difference

| Healthy Trance | Unhealthy Dissociation |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Focused inward | Disconnected from self |
| Body aware but relaxed | Body numb or absent |
| Identity intact | Identity blurred |
| Can return at will | Feels unable to return |
| Memory preserved | Memory gaps |
| Feels safe | Feels unsafe or floating |

---

## Warning Signs

### Language Warning Signs

If listener's internal experience includes:

- "I can't feel my body"
- "I don't know who I am"
- "I can't find my way back"
- "Everything feels unreal"
- "I'm floating away"
- "I've lost time"

### Script Warning Signs

Phrases that CAUSE dissociation (AVOID):

| Phrase | Risk | Alternative |
|--------|------|-------------|
| "Leave your body behind" | Body disconnection | "Let your body rest" |
| "Forget who you are" | Identity loss | "Release what's not you" |
| "Dissolve completely" | Ego dissolution | "Soften your boundaries" |
| "Drift away forever" | No return path | "Drift... knowing you can return" |
| "Nothing exists but..." | Reality loss | "This moment holds..." |
| "You are no one now" | Identity erasure | "You are becoming more yourself" |

## Guard Patterns

### Body Connection Guard

Insert at deepening points:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  And even as you go deeper... <break time="1.5s"/>
  part of you remains aware... <break time="1s"/>
  of your body breathing... <break time="1.5s"/>
  resting here... <break time="1.5s"/>
  solid and present.
</prosody>
```

### Identity Guard

Insert during transformation content:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  And through all of this... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you remain you... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the essential you... <break time="1.5s"/>
  that cannot be lost... <break time="2s"/>
  only deepened... <break time="1s"/>
  only enriched.
</prosody>
```

### Reality Guard

Insert after vivid imagery:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  And while this inner world is real... <break time="1.5s"/>
  in its own way... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you know... <break time="1s"/>
  you can open your eyes... <break time="1.5s"/>
  at any moment... <break time="1.5s"/>
  and be fully here.
</prosody>
```

### Return Path Guard

Insert every 3-5 minutes:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  Knowing at any moment... <break time="1s"/>
  you can choose to return... <break time="1.5s"/>
  that the way back... <break time="1s"/>
  is always open... <break time="1.5s"/>
  always accessible... <break time="1.5s"/>
  whenever you choose.
</prosody>
```

---

## High-Risk Scenarios

### Deep Trance (Layer 3+)

Require guards every 2 minutes:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  Going deep... <break time="1.5s"/>
  but never so deep... <break time="1s"/>
  that you lose yourself... <break time="2s"/>
  part of you watching... <break time="1.5s"/>
  part of you present... <break time="1.5s"/>
  always.
</prosody>
```

### Identity Transformation Work

Before any identity content:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  What you're about to experience... <break time="1.5s"/>
  may shift something... <break time="1.5s"/>
  but the core of you... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the you that witnesses... <break time="1.5s"/>
  remains unchanged... <break time="2s"/>
  watching... <break time="1s"/>
  learning... <break time="1s"/>
  integrating.
</prosody>
```

### Archetypal Encounters

When introducing guides or archetypes:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  An image may form... <break time="1.5s"/>
  a representation... <break time="1s"/>
  of wisdom within you... <break time="2s"/>
  not separate from you... <break time="1.5s"/>
  but part of you... <break time="1.5s"/>
  expressed in symbolic form.
</prosody>
```

## Emergency Response

If dissociation signs appear, immediate grounding:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  Right now... <break time="1s"/>
  I want you to feel your feet... <break time="1.5s"/>
  really feel them... <break time="1.5s"/>
  pressing into the surface beneath you... <break time="2s"/>

  Feel your hands... <break time="1.5s"/>
  maybe press them together gently... <break time="2s"/>

  Take a breath... <break time="1.5s"/>
  a full, deep breath... <break time="2s"/>

  You are here... <break time="1.5s"/>
  in your body... <break time="1.5s"/>
  safe... <break time="1.5s"/>
  present... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you.
</prosody>
```

## Script Validation Rules

Every script MUST:

- [ ] Include body awareness at least every 3 minutes
- [ ] Never suggest identity dissolution
- [ ] Provide return path every 5 minutes minimum
- [ ] Avoid void/nothingness imagery without anchors
- [ ] Include grounding before deepest content
- [ ] Never remove critical thinking ("trust without questioning")
- [ ] Keep God as only entity listener "surrenders" to

Every script MUST NOT:

- [ ] Suggest leaving the body
- [ ] Imply forgetting who you are
- [ ] Use "dissolve," "disappear," "nothing" without grounding
- [ ] Remove sense of time without restoration
- [ ] Introduce autonomous entities that command
