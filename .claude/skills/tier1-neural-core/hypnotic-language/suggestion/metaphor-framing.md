# Metaphor Framing Patterns

Story-based delivery that bypasses resistance and creates lasting transformation.

---

## Core Principle

**Metaphors speak to the unconscious mind directly.**

Instead of explaining what should happen, tell a story that demonstrates it. The unconscious extracts the lesson without conscious resistance.

---

## Why Metaphors Work

1. **Bypass resistance** — Stories don't trigger defenses
2. **Parallel processing** — Conscious follows story while unconscious applies meaning
3. **Multi-level impact** — Same story can mean different things to different listeners
4. **Memory encoding** — Stories are remembered longer than instructions
5. **Biblical precedent** — Jesus taught primarily through parables

---

## Metaphor Types

### 1. Direct Metaphors

Clear comparison between story and situation:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  Like a tree in winter... <break time="1.5s"/>
  that has released its leaves... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you too can let go... <break time="1s"/>
  of what no longer serves... <break time="2s"/>
  trusting that spring will come... <break time="1.5s"/>
  and new growth with it.
</prosody>
```

### 2. Embedded Metaphors

Stories within stories that deepen impact:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  There was once a garden... <break time="1.5s"/>
  where a small seed waited... <break time="1.5s"/>
  in the dark soil... <break time="2s"/>
  and while it waited... <break time="1s"/>
  it remembered a story... <break time="1.5s"/>
  about another seed... <break time="1.5s"/>
  that had learned to trust... <break time="1s"/>
  the darkness... <break time="2s"/>
  as the place where transformation begins.
</prosody>
```

### 3. Journey Metaphors

Movement through space represents inner change:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-2st">
  A path opens before you... <break time="1.5s"/>
  leading from where you've been... <break time="1.5s"/>
  toward something new... <break time="2s"/>
  each step leaving the old... <break time="1.5s"/>
  a little further behind.
</prosody>
```

### 4. Container Metaphors

Safe spaces that hold difficult experiences:

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  Imagine a sacred vessel... <break time="1.5s"/>
  strong enough to hold... <break time="1s"/>
  whatever you need to release... <break time="2s"/>
  and wise enough to transform it... <break time="1.5s"/>
  into something useful... <break time="1.5s"/>
  in its own time.
</prosody>
```

## Biblical Metaphor Templates

### The Shepherd (Psalm 23)

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  Like a sheep... <break time="1s"/>
  that finally stops running... <break time="1.5s"/>
  and allows itself to be led... <break time="1.5s"/>
  to still waters... <break time="2s"/>
  you can rest now... <break time="1.5s"/>
  in the care of the One... <break time="1s"/>
  who knows you completely.
</prosody>
```

### The Potter (Isaiah 64:8)

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  Sometimes we must be softened... <break time="1.5s"/>
  before we can be shaped... <break time="2s"/>
  clay in the hands of the Potter... <break time="1.5s"/>
  learning to trust... <break time="1s"/>
  the gentle pressure... <break time="1.5s"/>
  that forms us into something beautiful.
</prosody>
```

### The Vine (John 15)

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  Like a branch... <break time="1s"/>
  that has been pruned... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you may feel the ache... <break time="1.5s"/>
  of what was cut away... <break time="2s"/>
  but soon... <break time="1s"/>
  new growth will emerge... <break time="1.5s"/>
  stronger... <break time="1s"/>
  more fruitful... <break time="1.5s"/>
  than before.
</prosody>
```

## Metaphor Construction Rules

### Do

- Match metaphor to listener's experience
- Keep the story simple and clear
- Let the unconscious draw conclusions
- Use sensory-rich language
- Include resolution or hope

### Don't

- Explain the metaphor explicitly
- Use metaphors that contradict values
- Force a single interpretation
- Use violent or disturbing imagery
- Leave metaphors unresolved

---

## Outcome-to-Metaphor Mapping

| Outcome | Effective Metaphors |
|---------|-------------------|
| Healing | Water cleansing, light filling wounds, seasons changing |
| Transformation | Butterfly, seed becoming tree, fire refining gold |
| Confidence | Mountain standing firm, lion waking, eagle rising |
| Relaxation | Still water, soft clouds, gentle breeze |
| Release | River carrying away, balloon rising, snow melting |
| Growth | Garden tending, tree rooting, path unfolding |

---

## Isomorphic Metaphors

Create stories structurally identical to the listener's situation:

**Listener's situation**: Feeling stuck in old patterns

**Isomorphic metaphor**:
```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  There was a river... <break time="1.5s"/>
  that had flowed the same path... <break time="1.5s"/>
  for so long... <break time="2s"/>
  it had forgotten... <break time="1s"/>
  there were other ways to flow... <break time="2s"/>
  until one day... <break time="1.5s"/>
  a small stone shifted... <break time="1.5s"/>
  and the water discovered... <break time="1.5s"/>
  a new direction... <break time="2s"/>
  had been waiting all along.
</prosody>
```

## Validation Rules

- [ ] Metaphor matches intended outcome
- [ ] Story has clear beginning, middle, resolution
- [ ] No explicit interpretation forced
- [ ] Imagery aligns with Christian values
- [ ] Sensory language present
- [ ] Hope or positive resolution included
