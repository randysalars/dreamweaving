# Reorientation Patterns

Return to full waking awareness with clarity and integration.

---

## Core Principle

**Emergence is as important as induction.**

Every journey needs a complete return. Incomplete emergence leaves listeners disoriented, disconnected, or in residual trance states.

---

## The Reorientation Sequence

```
1. Announcement (emergence is coming)
2. Body awareness (sensory reconnection)
3. Environmental awareness (room, sounds, light)
4. Time orientation (present moment)
5. Identity reaffirmation (you are you)
6. Integration check (how do you feel?)
```

## Pattern Library

### 1. Gentle Announcement

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  And now... <break time="1.5s"/>
  it's time to begin... <break time="1s"/>
  your return... <break time="1.5s"/>
  bringing with you... <break time="1s"/>
  everything that serves you... <break time="1.5s"/>
  from this journey.
</prosody>
```

### 2. Body Reconnection

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  Begin to feel your body... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the weight of your arms... <break time="1s"/>
  and legs... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the surface beneath you... <break time="2s"/>
  perhaps gently moving... <break time="1s"/>
  your fingers... <break time="1s"/>
  and toes.
</prosody>
```

### 3. Sensory Return

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  Notice the sounds around you... <break time="1.5s"/>
  near and far... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the temperature of the air... <break time="1s"/>
  on your skin... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the gentle pressure... <break time="1s"/>
  of your body... <break time="1s"/>
  resting here.
</prosody>
```

### 4. Time Restoration

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  And time flows normally now... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you know where you are... <break time="1s"/>
  what day it is... <break time="1.5s"/>
  fully present... <break time="1s"/>
  in this moment.
</prosody>
```

### 5. Complete Emergence

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  When you're ready... <break time="1.5s"/>
  and only when you're ready... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you can allow your eyes to open... <break time="2s"/>
  feeling refreshed... <break time="1s"/>
  alert... <break time="1s"/>
  and fully present... <break time="1.5s"/>
  taking all the time you need.
</prosody>
```

## Full Reorientation Template

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  <!-- Announcement -->
  And now... <break time="1.5s"/>
  this journey is gently coming to a close... <break time="2s"/>

  <!-- Body awareness -->
  Begin to feel your body again... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the weight of your limbs... <break time="1s"/>
  the breath moving in and out... <break time="2s"/>

  <!-- Environmental awareness -->
  Notice the sounds in the room... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the temperature of the air... <break time="1.5s"/>
  the surface supporting you... <break time="2s"/>

  <!-- Time orientation -->
  Knowing where you are... <break time="1s"/>
  aware of this present moment... <break time="1.5s"/>

  <!-- Identity reaffirmation -->
  You are you... <break time="1s"/>
  completely yourself... <break time="1.5s"/>
  perhaps a little different... <break time="1s"/>
  yet fully you... <break time="2s"/>

  <!-- Integration check -->
  And when you're ready... <break time="1.5s"/>
  take a full breath... <break time="2s"/>
  and allow your eyes to open... <break time="2s"/>
  bringing back with you... <break time="1s"/>
  everything you need... <break time="1.5s"/>
  from this experience.
</prosody>
```

## Pacing Guidelines

| Session Depth | Emergence Duration |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Light (relaxation only) | 1-2 minutes |
| Moderate (standard journey) | 2-3 minutes |
| Deep (Layer 3+) | 3-5 minutes |
| Very deep (helm_deep_trance) | 5-7 minutes |

**Rule**: Deeper trance = slower emergence

---

## Safety Requirements

Every emergence MUST include:

1. **Body awareness** — Physical sensation reconnection
2. **Environmental grounding** — Room/sounds/temperature
3. **Time orientation** — Present moment awareness
4. **Agency return** — "when you're ready," "in your own time"
5. **Completeness check** — Feeling alert, refreshed

---

## Forbidden Patterns

| Pattern | Why Dangerous |
|---------|---------------|
| Abrupt ending | Leaves listener in trance |
| "Wake up!" | Jarring, can cause anxiety |
| No body reconnection | Dissociation risk |
| Skipping time orientation | Temporal confusion |
| "You'll stay relaxed" | Doesn't complete emergence |

---

## Post-Deep-Trance Protocol

After deep journeys (Layer 3+, helm_deep_trance):

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  Take all the time you need... <break time="2s"/>
  there's no rush at all... <break time="2s"/>

  <!-- Extra grounding -->
  Feel the solidness of the ground... <break time="1.5s"/>
  your connection to the earth... <break time="2s"/>

  <!-- Explicit time restoration -->
  The clock ticks at its normal pace... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you know exactly where you are... <break time="1.5s"/>
  exactly when it is... <break time="2s"/>

  <!-- Movement invitation -->
  Perhaps gently stretching... <break time="1.5s"/>
  moving your body... <break time="1.5s"/>
  in whatever way feels good... <break time="2s"/>

  <!-- Delayed eye opening -->
  And when you're fully ready... <break time="1.5s"/>
  not a moment before... <break time="1.5s"/>
  your eyes can open... <break time="2s"/>
  refreshed and clear.
</prosody>
```
