# Permissive Language Patterns

Choice-preserving framing that maintains listener sovereignty throughout the experience.

---

## Core Principle

Every suggestion should feel like an **invitation** that the listener can accept, modify, or decline.

---

## The Permissive Formula

**Command**: "Relax now."
**Permissive**: "You can allow yourself to relax... in your own way... in your own time."

---

## Permission Markers

### Possibility Words
- "You might notice..."
- "Perhaps you'll find..."
- "You may become aware..."
- "It's possible that..."
- "You could allow..."

### Choice Affirmations
- "...in whatever way feels right for you"
- "...whenever you're ready"
- "...if that feels comfortable"
- "...to whatever degree you choose"
- "...in your own time"

### Escape Clauses
- "...or not, that's perfectly fine too"
- "...and you can adjust this at any time"
- "...knowing you remain in control"
- "...free to return whenever you wish"

---

## Pattern Library

### 1. Basic Permission Structure

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  You might allow yourself... <break time="1s"/>
  to drift a little deeper... <break time="1.5s"/>
  in whatever way feels right... <break time="1s"/>
  for you... <break time="1s"/>
  right now.
</prosody>
```

### 2. Embedded Choice

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  I don't know whether you'll notice... <break time="1s"/>
  the relaxation beginning in your shoulders... <break time="1s"/>
  or perhaps your hands... <break time="1.5s"/>
  or somewhere else entirely... <break time="1s"/>
  but you can simply allow... <break time="1s"/>
  whatever wants to happen.
</prosody>
```

### 3. Safety-Wrapped Suggestion

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="0st">
  And as you go deeper... <break time="1.5s"/>
  you can know... <break time="1s"/>
  that part of you remains aware... <break time="1s"/>
  watching over this experience... <break time="1.5s"/>
  ready to bring you back... <break time="1s"/>
  whenever you choose.
</prosody>
```

### 4. Open-Ended Invitation

```xml
<prosody rate="1.0" pitch="-1st">
  Perhaps something begins to shift... <break time="1.5s"/>
  a feeling... <break time="1s"/>
  an image... <break time="1s"/>
  a sense of something... <break time="1.5s"/>
  and you can simply be curious... <break time="1s"/>
  about what wants to emerge.
</prosody>
```

## Transformation Table

| Directive | Permissive Version |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Close your eyes" | "You might allow your eyes to close, when that feels right" |
| "Take a deep breath" | "Perhaps you'll notice your breath deepening naturally" |
| "Relax your body" | "You can allow your body to find its own comfort" |
| "Listen to my voice" | "My voice can accompany you, as much as you like" |
| "Go deeper" | "And if you'd like to drift a little deeper..." |
| "Imagine a garden" | "Perhaps an image begins to form... maybe a garden..." |
| "Feel peaceful" | "You might notice a sense of peace beginning to settle" |

## Christian-Safe Additions

For Dreamweaver's Christian framing, add these permission markers:

```xml
<s>And if it feels right... <break time="1s"/>
you can simply invite God's presence... <break time="1.5s"/>
to be with you here... <break time="1s"/>
in whatever way feels true.</s>
```

**Key**: God is invited, not commanded to appear. The listener chooses engagement.

## Forbidden Structures

| Structure | Why Prohibited | Alternative |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| "You will now..." | Commands | "You might now..." |
| "I want you to..." | External authority | "You can allow yourself to..." |
| "You must..." | No escape | "Perhaps you'll find..." |
| "Let me..." | Removes agency | "You might invite..." |
| "Surrender to..." | Ego risk | "You can gently allow..." |

---

## Validation Rules

Generated SSML should be checked for:

1. **Permission marker density**: At least 1 per 3-4 sentences
2. **Absence of commands**: No imperative verbs without softeners
3. **Escape clause presence**: Safety exits every 2-3 minutes
4. **Choice language**: Options offered, not dictated
