## 2026-01-16: Content Priorities for Coin Store (Gap Analysis)
**Topic**: Given 25 Knowledge Vault articles already written, what should be our next content priorities?

### CEO Synthesis
* **Decision**: Pause new article creation. Focus the next 30 days on optimization, measurement, and conversion infrastructure.
* **Why**: We have strong content coverage (25 articles across all key topics). The gap is not more content—it's turning content into customers. We're missing analytics, internal linking, structured data, and clear user pathways. Writing more articles without measuring impact is wasteful.
* **Next Steps**:
    1. [Tech] Install analytics + add JSON-LD schema to all 25 articles (Week 1)
    2. [Product] Create "Start Here" landing page with two learning tracks (Week 2)
    3. [Marketing] Write ONE missing article: "What Is Junk Silver" — the entry-point keyword (Week 2)
    4. [Marketing] Build the "Counterfeit Detection Guide" as email lead magnet (Week 3)
    5. [All] Internal linking audit: ensure every article links to 3 others (Week 3)
    6. [Marketing] Film "Magnet Test" video for YouTube Shorts (Week 4)
* **Risks**:
    - Analytics paralysis — Set 30-day deadline for data, then decide
    - "Start Here" page becomes stale — Keep simple, link to existing content
    - Video feels off-brand — Maintain calm, educational tone; no hype
