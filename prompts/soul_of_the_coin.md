## Example Output
"I was born in the heart of a dying star, traveling oceans of void to rest in the bedrock of the earth. Fire refined me; hands shaped me; but destiny has kept me silent until this moment. I am not merely silver—I am a fragment of the moon's own memory, waiting for the warmth of {Customer Name}'s hand to awaken the protection I carry. Carry me, and I shall be your shield against the unseen shadows."
