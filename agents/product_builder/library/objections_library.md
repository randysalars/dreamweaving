# Objections Library

Pre-written responses to common objections for reuse across products.

## Time Objections

### "I don't have time for this"
**Response**: This system was designed for people with 30 minutes a day. If you have time to scroll social media, you have time for this. The question isn't whether you have time—it's whether this is a priority.

### "I'm too busy right now, maybe later"
**Response**: "Later" is where good intentions go to die. The best time to start was a year ago. The second best time is today. This system is designed to fit into your existing life, not replace it.

## Money Objections

### "It's too expensive"
**Response**: Compared to what? A weekend getaway? A month of streaming services? This is an investment in yourself that pays dividends for years. The real cost is staying where you are.

### "I can find this information for free online"
**Response**: You can. It'll take you 200 hours to piece it together, filter the bad advice, and figure out what actually works. Or you can get the distilled, battle-tested version in a weekend.

## Skepticism Objections

### "How do I know this will work for me?"
**Response**: You don't—until you try. What I can tell you is that this approach has worked for [specific number] people across [specific contexts]. The principles are timeless, the application is up to you.

### "I've tried things like this before"
**Response**: I hear you. Most approaches fail because they're either too theoretical or too rigid. This is different: it's principles you adapt, not rules you follow. But you'll only know when you engage with it.

### "Everyone claims their system is the best"
**Response**: I'm not claiming it's the best. I'm claiming it works, it's honest, and it respects your intelligence. That's a low bar that most products fail to clear.

## Competence Objections

### "I'm not [smart/educated/disciplined] enough"
**Response**: This isn't about talent. It's about having the right framework. The people who succeed aren't smarter—they have better systems. That's what you're getting here.

### "My situation is unique"
**Response**: Your details are unique. The underlying principles are universal. Every person who built wealth, got healthy, or changed their life did it by applying timeless principles to their specific situation.

## Procrastination Objections

### "I need to think about it"
**Response**: That's fair. But ask yourself: are you thinking, or are you avoiding? If you genuinely need time, take it. If you're using "thinking" as a delay tactic, recognize that pattern.

### "I'll start after [event/date]"
**Response**: The perfect time never arrives. There's always another event, another excuse. The people who change their lives are the ones who start despite imperfect timing.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Never use these verbatim** - adapt to your product's voice
2. **Acknowledge the objection first** - don't be dismissive
3. **Provide evidence when possible** - numbers, examples, logic
4. **End with agency** - the reader makes the choice, you provide the clarity
