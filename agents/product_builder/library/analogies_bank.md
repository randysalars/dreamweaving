## Usage Guidelines

1. **One fresh metaphor per page maximum** - too many becomes exhausting
2. **Extend, don't abandon** - if you use a metaphor, return to it later
3. **Make it concrete** - "like a river" is weaker than "like a river cutting through limestone"
4. **Avoid clichés** - if it appears in a motivational poster, find a better version
